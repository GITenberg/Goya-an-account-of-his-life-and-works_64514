<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been said that in England everybody knows of Cervantes, but very
few persons have more than a nodding acquaintance with <i>Don Quixote</i>,
and Goya’s reputation in this country is even less securely founded. The
great Aragonese is indeed little more than a name to the general public,
and his work is literally unknown. Two little books&mdash;Mr. W.
Rothenstein’s <i>Goya</i>, now out of print, and a monograph by Mr. Richard
Muther in the Langham Series&mdash;are the only volumes in English dealing
exclusively with a painter who for more than half a century might have
been described, with more aptness than that with which the words were
applied to Zurbarán, as ‘All Spain.’ As sincere a lover and as brilliant
a transcriber of the beautiful as Watteau and Van Loo, a greater realist
than Hogarth, and in portraiture second only to Velazquez, Goya stands
out as the greatest artist Spain has produced since the death of the
great Court painter of Philip <small>IV.</small></p>

<p>The fact that Spanish art reflects the aspirations and is largely
concerned with the repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>sentation of scenes selected by its chief
patron, the Spanish Catholic Church, accounts, in some measure, for the
lack of sympathy and appreciation with which it is regarded in this
country, but this prejudice does not explain the neglect from which Goya
has suffered. Goya, it is true, accepted commissions from the Church,
but his religious subjects do not comprise a tenth of his canvases, and
in his etchings and engravings he is seen only as a secular moralist. As
the painter of the Spanish Rococo period, he dipped his brush in beauty,
gaiety, and humour; as a portraitist he was vivid, surprising,
audacious, a maker of masterpieces; while his etchings constitute an
unrivalled commentary upon the spirit of the age, recorded by its ‘most
fearless and advanced thinker.’</p>

<p>Goya’s art would appear to be the reflection of his life. His youth was
disordered and tempestuous; in the height of his success he accepted
favours, but he was too conscientious an artist to repay the adulation
of the world by flattering it in his canvases; and he published his
disillusions in the biting satire of his Caprices and Proverbs.</p>

<p>The authorities I have consulted would make a formidable list, but among
those to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> I am under special obligation I must mention the ‘Lives’
of Goya by the Conde de la Viñaza, Paul Lefort, Paul Lafond, W.
Rothenstein, Richard Muther and Julius Hofmann; Valerian von Loga’s
works on Goya’s etchings and engravings; Don Juan de la Rada’s chapter
on ‘Goya’s Frescoes in the Church of San Antonio de la Florida;’
Muther’s appreciation of Goya in his <i>History of Modern Painting</i>;
Stirling-Maxwell’s <i>Annals of the Artists of Spain</i>; Carl Justi’s
‘Sketch of Spanish Art’ in Baedeker’s <i>Spain and Portugal</i>; C. Gasquoine
Hartley’s <i>Spanish Painting</i>; the <i>Boletin de la Sociedad Española de
Excursiones</i>; and Théophile Gautier’s brilliant study of Goya in his
<i>Travels in Spain</i>.</p>

<p>In making the collection of Goya’s works that is presented at the end of
this volume, I have taken the line of least resistance and included
reproductions of every picture, etching, or lithograph that I could
acquire. However inadequate photography and ‘process’ may be to convey
an impression of the original works, I have endeavoured to give English
students an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the subjects and
general nature of much of the output of Goya’s sixty years of artistic
effort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span></p>

<p>In the compilation of the appended exhaustive catalogue of Goya’s works,
which I am not without hope may be found of practical value, I have
derived no little assistance from Spanish and German publications and
from the list prepared by M. Paul Lafond. To Señor Don Mariano Moreno,
who has made a special study of Goya and his work, I am indebted for
descriptions of many pictures which are published here for the first
time, and my thanks are also due to him for permission to reproduce from
his collection a number of photographs which were new to me. I have also
to acknowledge the kindness of the authorities of the Academy of San
Fernando in allowing me to publish copies of the different prints of
Goya’s works issued by the Academy; and to express my thanks to Señor
Don J. Lacoste, Messrs. Braun, Clement and Co., Messrs. Mansell and Co.,
and Herr Franz Hanfstaengl, for their courtesy in supplying me with
various pictures included in this collection and permitting me to
reproduce them.</p>

<h2><a name="GOYA" id="GOYA"></a>GOYA</h2>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<p class="nind">A <span class="smcap">century</span> before the birth of Goya, Spanish painting had attained its
crown of achievement in the work of the four great naturalists,
Velazquez, Ribera, Zurbarán, and Murillo. Josef de Ribera (‘Lo
Spagnoletto’), had succeeded Ribalta, and had given lasting expression
to the realism which characterised Spanish art in the seventeenth
century; Francisco de Zurbarán, the Estremaduran peasant, whom Lord
Leighton called ‘All Spain,’ carried on the tradition of the elder
Herrera in his passion for truth in detail and in the dramatic intensity
of his expression; Murillo, the disciple of the Spanish Catholic Church,
bewitched his generation with what Antonio Castillo y Saavedra described
as his ‘wondrous grace and beauty of colouring’; and Velazquez, ‘our
Velazquez,’ as Palomino proudly styled him, was the supreme painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span>
through whom Spanish art became the light of a new artistic life.</p>

<p>Of Velazquez it has been said that he attained perfection in the realism
of detail and in the realism of sight, and in his commanding genius
Spanish art was emancipated from the fetters of pseudo-Italianism in
which it had laboured so long. He carried Spanish realism to its Ultima
Thule. Further his age could not go, and generations of artists who came
after him devoted themselves to the imitation and reproduction of his
colour and his technique with such passionate servility that in the end
the copy of the pupil was frequently mistaken for the work of the
master. The perfect technique of the great Court painter had, in his own
day, the effect of arresting artistic development&mdash;it left his
successors nothing to solve for themselves. He achieved so much in his
own work that, for a time, the last word in art seemed to have been
spoken. Until his influence had died away, the reproduction of Velazquez
was the aim of the Madrid painters. For this reason, after the death of
Velazquez, the artistic life of the seventeenth century became a spent
force, and for want of new impetus of original genius, Spanish art
steadily declined. The followers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> the supreme painter failed to
realise the true inwardness of his message. They had the seed, but they
could raise no new flower. One feels towards the pictures of Velazquez
as Swinburne felt towards the muse of Sappho:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">’ ... earth’s womb has borne in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New things, and never this best thing again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne days and men, borne fruits and wars and wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seasons and songs but no song more like mine.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But the reverent desire to perpetuate ‘this best thing’ could not arrest
the decay of artistic inspiration. The disciples of Velazquez copied and
painted successfully (up to a point), and they trained other generations
of imitators who continued to work and teach their methods, until
imitation slowly but surely sank into artistic degradation. Under the
sway of Mariana of Austria, the decay of Spanish painting was further
hastened, and the ascendency of the facile, brilliant brush of Luca
Giordano, under Charles <small>II.</small>, dealt the death-blow to the realistic
impulse that had carried the national school of the middle seventeenth
century to the realisation of its utmost ambition.</p>

<p>The decadence which followed the death of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>Velazquez was most pronounced
among the Castilian painters, but the empire of Giordano extended to the
Provincial schools and completed the more gradual decline of art in
Andalusia and Valencia. Seville was foredoomed to decadence as a school
of painting, for its artists had taken Murillo as their model, and in
servilely imitating the ‘Painter of the Conceptions,’ they emphasised
his faults, exaggerated his unreality, and caricatured his affectations.
The popular admiration of Murillo was all-powerful to hasten the general
decline, and each year the artistic outgrowth of Andalusia became more
enfeebled.</p>

<p>In the last months of the seventeenth century Charles <small>II.</small> died without
issue and the art-loving Austrian dynasty was ended. The succeeding
Bourbon sovereigns brought with them an art derived from France; they
had no ambition to reanimate the native art of the country. Madrid
became the only recognised art centre in Spain, and to Madrid, in 1761,
came, at the invitation of Charles <small>III.</small>, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, the
Venetian fresco-painter, and the Saxon pedant, Anton Raphael Mengs. The
Spanish painters who had rendered homage to the facile Giordano were
caught by the glamour of the fantastic, insincere art of Tiepolo, while
the dreary academic influence of Mengs&mdash;whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> paintings are declared by
Carl Justi to echo the last shadow of eclectic mannerism&mdash;made for all
that is dull, exact, and lifeless in pictorial art. No great Spaniard
arose to counteract the demoralising influence of these imported
professors; it was realised in the studios of Madrid that the methods of
the favoured aliens led to popularity and fortune; the Spanish artists
followed the line of least resistance, nor desisted when they found that
it carried them ever further from the tradition founded by Velazquez.</p>

<p>This art, dull but without dignity, showy but meaningless, was the
reflex of the prevailing rottenness in the national life. During the
reign of Charles <small>III.</small> a certain superficial decency was observed; the
corruptness of Court life was kept out of sight; a general conspiracy of
make-believe was maintained. But under Maria Luisa of Parma and Charles
<small>IV.</small>, the abomination of moral desolation in social, political and
artistic life was complete and confessed. Manuel Godoy, afterwards
Prince de la Paz, was Prime Minister of Spain, and the country was
demoralised by dissolute courtiers and unscrupulous ministers, and
drained by insatiable priests. But in the turmoil created by an
aristocracy sunk in lasciviousness, a government steeped in cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>ruption,
and a commonalty beaten and bled into a state of nerveless resignation,
was heard the echo of the revolutionary movement which was sweeping over
Europe. The teaching of Goethe and Schiller, followed by the preaching
of Rousseau, had taken concrete form in the butcheries of Robespierre
and Danton; the movement had culminated in the personal supremacy of
Napoleon Buonaparte.</p>

<p>The hopes of the Spanish nation were centred in the Crown Prince
Ferdinand. Even as the First of the Tigers thought to exterminate Fear
by killing a man, the Spaniards believed that the abdication of Charles
<small>IV.</small> would make an end of misrule and give their country peace and
prosperity. But the King hated his son, and inspired by the double
purpose of defeating the ambition of the Crown Prince and punishing the
disloyalty of his subjects, he laid his crown at the feet of the Emperor
of the French, who bestowed it upon his brother, Joseph Buonaparte. The
Spanish liberals made the alien king welcome, but the Spanish loyalists
proved a constant thorn in the side of the usurper, and at the end of
five years Joseph Buonaparte fled Madrid. Two years later the Prince of
the Asturias returned to Spain to be crowned king as Ferdinand <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><small>VII.</small>
Again the distressful country was plunged into the depths of
retrogression, clericalism, and fanaticism. Spain was undergoing her
fate.</p>

<p>The strong men of the troublous times of the eighteenth century were the
revolutionaries and reformers, and, as was inevitable, they sprang from
the people. Rousseau, Robespierre, Napoleon, these were the forces that
directed the movement, the effect of which was to make itself felt from
one end of Europe to the other. Goya was a revolutionary. He lived under
four kings of Spain. He was elected a member of the Académia de San
Fernando in the reign of Charles <small>III.</small>; Charles <small>IV.</small> appointed him <i>Pintor
de Cámara del Rey</i>; he took the oath of allegiance to Joseph Buonaparte
and painted the usurper’s portrait; Ferdinand <small>VII.</small>, who declared that he
had deserved death for his defection from the Bourbon cause, condemned
the man but pardoned the artist and received him as a member of the new
Court. Critical opinion condones Goya’s flexible patriotism by the fact
that ‘it was a period of national disaster,’ and that ‘national calamity
was not altered by these trivialities.’</p>

<p>Goya, we are reminded, was a revolutionary; he was also a pitiless, if
quizzical, onlooker at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> the life of the Madrid Court. It was a simple
matter to him to transfer his allegiance from the Bourbons to Joseph
Buonaparte, and it was even more simple to welcome Ferdinand <small>VII.</small> to the
throne. ‘What did such changes matter in years of irretrievable ruin?’
writes C. Gasquoine Hartley, in <i>A Record of Spanish Painting</i>. The
question may be left for the individual to answer according to his own
fancy. And if Goya was, as some will find, an opportunist, a political
weathercock, and a moral Vicar of Bray, as an artist he was a great
reformative force. Alternately an idealist and a realist, he fought with
all the social forces and against the academic standards of the school
commanded by David and Mengs, destroying the debased conventions of
painting and freeing the brush from the domination of a clique. A
national artist <i>par excellence</i>, he gave lasting form to the
sentiments, customs and conditions of his country. A profound believer
in empiricism, a great humourist, sometimes impetuous and fantastic, at
other times holding fast to reality; a master of portraiture; fantastic,
inspired, spontaneous in his aquafortis etchings; he seized upon and
immortalised every aspect of the gruesome tragi-comedy which was played
in Spain in the last years of the eighteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<p>Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes was born at the end of March (the
30th or 31st) 1746 at Fuentetodos near Zaragoza, in Aragon, the province
which gave to the nation poets like the ‘Spanish Horaces,’ historians
like Zurita, teachers like Gracián and Luzán, a scholar like Latassa,
and a statesman like the Conde de Aranda. Goya was baptized in the
Church of Our Lady of the Ascent, and the names given him by his
godmother, Francesca de Grasa, were Francis Joseph. The amiable weakness
for connecting great men with great families has prompted a German
biographer to claim that both his father and mother belonged to the
nobility, and that his first patron was the Duque de Fuentes. Less
imaginative authorities, however, tell us that his parents, José Goya
and Gracia Lucientes, were poor but hardworking peasants, and that when
‘the regenerator of the Spanish school of naturalistic painters’&mdash;to
quote the prefatory note to Goya’s pictures in the Prado catalogue&mdash;had
completed his course of elementary instruction at the hands of the
village schoolmaster, he was put to agriculture. A fortunate accident
revealed the bent of the lad’s genius and liberated him, at the age of
fourteen, from the drudgery of manual labour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span></p>

<p>M. Matheron relates that the lad had been sent with a sack of wheat to a
neighbouring mill, when a monk of Zaragoza (probably Father Felix
Salvador of the Carthusian convent of Aula Dei) happened upon him. Goya,
seated on his burden, was intent upon drawing a pig with a piece of
charcoal upon a whitewashed wall. The priest, struck by the correct free
lines traced by the youngster, inquired who his master was and received
the characteristic reply: ‘I have none, your reverence. It is not my
fault, I cannot keep from drawing.’ The overmastering incentive pleaded
by the youthful delinquent never forsook him, and, although powerful
enemies resented his too free use of the pencil, and the Holy
Inquisition was moved to curb his unwearied industry, he continued to
ply brush and needle and gavel during sixty-eight years of changing,
strenuous life. Father Salvador remained Goya’s friend until his death.
He saw his father, and obtained permission from him, in 1760, for the
lad to go to Zaragoza. The imperial city exercised a powerful influence
upon his art. There is always in his pictures, as one of his countrymen
points out, the Zaragoza landscape, so rich in the contrasts of its
splendid and vigorous vegetation, recalling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> the banks of the Genil or
the Turia, while its limy hills and grey plains bring to the memory the
vistas of Castile. The melancholy of the sky&mdash;pierced by the severe
lines of innumerable towers and bounded by the austere distant
rock&mdash;remind us that here the sun has not the same suggested warmth that
supplied the rays for Murillo’s brush; that this is not the land of
fancy but the land of genius, cold as the snow of the Moncayo, that adds
beauty to the beautiful plants which produce not sweet odours but
healing balsams.</p>

<p>Thanks to the friendly offices of Father Salvador, Goya was admitted to
the studio of José Luzán y Martinez, whose religious and historical
pictures bear evidence of soft fresh colouring. He attended, too, the
school founded in 1714 by the sculptor Juan Ramirez, a pupil of the
well-intentioned Gregoria de Mesa. In the studio of Martinez, Goya, who
from the first betrayed his lifelong passion for realism, worked with
untiring ardour, stimulated, it may be, by the industry of his
co-pupils, José Beratón, Tómas Vallespin, and the Huesca jeweller,
Antonio Martinez, who founded, in Madrid, the silversmith’s business
which still bears his name. ‘In the schools of Zaragoza,’ says C.
Gasquoine<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> Hartley, ‘he followed no conventional standards, and his
continuous study was directed to the development of his exuberant
individuality. To comprehend the truth, and afterwards to depict it, as
it pleased his ever-varying fancy, this was his great aim. His utterance
was inevitable and instinctive, the overflow of his dramatic,
inexhaustible and vivid imagination.’</p>

<p>Goya’s exuberant, passionate temperament betrayed itself in other
directions outside his art. He lived, as he worked, in a condition of
unconventional, even arrogant independence. Many tales of the wild
escapades of his youth are told. His revolutionary tendencies embroiled
him in frequent altercations; thrice he is said to have fallen under the
ban of the Inquisition. Zaragoza finally grew unsafe for him, and in
1766 he fled to Madrid. There are no discovered documents relating to
his first years in Madrid, and his biographers, for the most part,
preserve a discreet reticence concerning his mode of life in the
capital. It is supposed that he copied Velazquez, and the pictures at
the Casa de Campo, the seat of the Duque de Arcos. It has even been
surmised that, through his friendship with Bayeu, he had the entrée to
the royal palaces of La Zarzuela, Aranjuez, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span> Escorial. Other
writers favour the idea that he lived the life of a young revolutionary,
and Richard Muther, in his monograph of the painter, pictures him ‘wild
and passionate, an athlete in his physical strength,’ being ‘everywhere
present when dancing or love-making, scuffling or stabbing, is going
forward.’ The one outstanding fact, upon which most biographers are
agreed, is that one morning he was found lying in the streets with a
dagger in his back. This occurrence, supplemented, it is said, by his
misfortune in again incurring the displeasure of the Inquisition&mdash;some
hold that he was placed under police supervision&mdash;made him once more
seek safety in flight. He had a will to visit Rome, but no money to
defray his travelling expenses. Tradition declares that he joined
himself to a company of bull-fighters, worked his way to the coast as a
picador, and set sail for Italy.</p>

<p>Iriarte is the authority for most of the details concerning this period
of Goya’s career. French writers declare that the painter remained in
Italy from 1769 to 1774. There is a full-length likeness of Pope
Benedict <small>XIV.</small> still in the Vatican which is said to have been painted by
Goya in a few hours, but as that pontiff died in 1756 there is much
reason to doubt the truth of the legend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span></p>

<p>The Conde de la Viñaza in his <i>Life</i> of Goya refutes every detail of
this story. It is said that while Goya was in Italy he secured a prize
offered by the Parma Academy of Fine Arts for a picture of ‘Hannibal
surveying Rome from a pinnacle of the Alps,’ but the Conde maintains
that Goya at this time was in Spain and that it was in his own country
he painted his picture and carried off the second prize. In the <i>Mercure
de France</i> of January 1772 we read: ‘Le 27 Juin dernier l’Académie
Royale des Beaux Arts de Parme tint sa séance publique pour la
distribution de ses prix. Le sujet de peinture était: “Annibal vainqueur
du haut des Alpes jette ses premiers regards sur les campagnes
d’Italie.”... Le premier prix de peinture a été accordé au tableau qui
avait devise: “Montes fregit aceto,” et qui était de monsieur Paul
Borroni etc. Le second prix de peinture a été remporté par M. François
Goya romain (<i>sic</i>), élève de M. Vajeu, peintre du roi d’Espagne.’</p>

<p>The following paragraph by M. Paul Mantz from the same source is quoted
into the <i>Archives de l’art français</i>: ‘L’Académie a remarqué avec
plaisir dans le second tableau un beau maniement de pinceau, de la
chaleur d’expression dans le<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span> regard d’Annibal et un caractère de
grandeur dans l’attitude de ce général. Si M. Goya se fût moins écarté
dans sa composition du sujet du programme, et s’il eût mis plus de
vérité dans son coloris, il aurait balancé les suffrages pour le premier
prix.’</p>

<p>The Conde de la Viñaza, Goya’s Spanish biographer, maintains that this
picture was painted and the prize won before the artist went to Italy,
and he proves, by the publication of documents preserved in the Archives
of the Pilar Cathedral at Zaragoza, that in October 1771 the painter,
forsaking Madrid, was back on the banks of the Ebro in the enjoyment of
an enviable reputation. This is in direct contradiction to the old
stories describing a love adventure as the reason for his sudden and
hasty departure from Rome. A mad enterprise which had for its object the
rescue of a young maid from a convent ended, it is said, in his capture,
and he ‘only escaped the gallows by the most reckless and headlong
flight.’ This much we know, that Goya was in Zaragoza in 1771. He
returned not as a fugitive and an outlaw, but as a reputable citizen
having the confidence of the Cathedral authorities, who commissioned him
to paint the quadrangular vault in the Holy Chapel. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span> fresco which he
prepared as a proof that ‘he was experienced in this kind of painting,’
was submitted to the Building Committee of the Cathedral, on November
11, 1771, together with the director’s assurance that it had received
the approval of experts, and with Goya’s offer to paint the vault of the
small choir for 15,000 reals, he providing the labourers and materials.
The Committee, having heard this proposition and recognising it as
better than that made by Don Antonio Velazquez, who asked 25,000 reals
for the work, ‘agreed to Goya’s proposition, but in order to be safe and
sure,’ it was stipulated that he should make some further studies and
submit them to Madrid for the approval of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts
(San Fernando), ‘which obtained, the negotiations would be completed and
the contract signed.’</p>

<p>On January 27, 1772, Goya presented his study to the Committee, who
having ‘already been informed that it was a skilful piece of work in
specially good style,’ approved it, and waiving the stipulation that it
should be submitted to the Royal Academy, they decided that the artist
should forthwith proceed with the work. The documents give no
information concerning the progress of the work, but we learn from a
minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span> in the Building Committee’s meeting, held on June 1, 1772, that
the painting of the choir was nearly finished by that date, and the
scaffolding was about to be taken down.</p>

<p>We are without any authentic particulars concerning the next three years
of Goya’s life, but the Conde de la Viñaza supposes that with the 15,000
reals which this work brought him, he went to Italy. How he passed his
time there cannot be definitely stated, but many interesting surmises
have obtained currency. We are assured by Mr. Muther that for Goya ‘the
antique had no more existence than the magnificent art of the
<i>cinque-cento</i>: what attracted him was rather the teeming life of the
people. Out of the red robes of the priests, the costumes, gay with
colour, of the women of Trastevere, the merry, careless freedom of the
Lazzaroni, he created fragments of life, rich with all its varied
colour. Muleteers with their jangling cars, religious processions and
Carnivale masques,’ to say nothing of much ‘love-making, scuffling and
stabbing’&mdash;these are imagined to be the influences that directed his
genius during his stay in Italy. Paul Lafond (<i>Goya</i>), while admitting
the legendary element in most of the reported incidents in the life of
the painter, repeats the stories of his ascending<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span> to the lantern in the
dome of St. Peter’s, of his making a tour of Cecilia Melella’s tomb,
walking upright on the narrow ledge of the cornice, of his amatory
escapade at a convent and its resultant flight from Rome. He also adds
that his <i>genre</i> pictures attracted so much attention in Rome that the
Russian ambassador, instructed by his sovereign to invite a number of
distinguished artists to establish themselves at the Court at St.
Petersburg, made Goya a very tempting offer, which he refused. On the
other hand, the Conde de la Viñaza declares that ‘he was frequently seen
studying the most sublime frescoes in the land, leaning boldly on the
decorations of the architraves or on the most dangerous parts of the
cornices’; that he secured the necessaries of life by the sale of
pictures of the customs of his native land; that he made the
acquaintance of Luis David, for whom he formed a deep and lasting
attachment; and, finally, that ‘the only recollection he preserved of
Italy in his old age was of his having met there the painter of “The
Rape of the Sabines.”’</p>

<p>The friendship that existed between Goya and David has called attention
to the similarities in the temperament and the aims of the two men,
whose work was so widely different. Both used<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> their brushes to glorify
the throne and received honours from kings; both sacrificed tradition on
the altar of new ideas; and both lacked the tenderness and the faith
necessary in the treatment of religious subjects. David was the friend
of Robespierre and Saint Just, of Marat and Buonaparte; he painted the
‘Coronation of the Hero of the Pyramids’; he attended the Convention and
voted for the death of Louis <small>XVI.</small> Goya was the friend of Godoy and of
the ministers of Joseph Buonaparte; he painted the pictures of the
Usurper as well as those of the kings that preceded and followed him;
and he executed ‘The Disasters of War’ and ‘The Caprices.’ David was
ambitious for the aggrandisement of his art, and Goya strove to make it
worthy of its civilising mission, but they differed in the means by
which they sought to attain their respective ends. David was inspired by
the antique, and produced works which possessed the hardness of statuary
as well as its clear-cut accuracy of form, while Goya went direct to
nature for his inspiration, and his paintings are the reflections of
naked reality. The painter of ‘The Death of Socrates’ was imbued with
the guiding purpose of making his work dignified, elaborately accurate,
and ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span>clusive, while the author of the frescoes of La Florida, drawing
inspiration from the customs of the toilers and the dandies alike, held
that ‘a picture is finished when its effect is true.’ David represented
man endowed with improbable and unattractive virtues, Goya painted man
as he was; David idealised the individual form with classic grandeur,
and his austere and solemn compositions, though based on observation of
nature, were moulded to a fixed external idea; but Goya was as faithful
to psychologic truth as to anatomy, and his brush revealed the moral
sentiments of mankind and laid bare the passionate and terrible emotions
of the human soul.</p>

<p>When Goya returned to Madrid in 1775 Spanish art was directed by Mengs
and Tiepolo, by Maëlla and Francesco Bayeu. Mengs, the ‘reasoning
artificer,’ who had neglected the world of nature in his servile study
of Raphael and the antique, was a painter who theorised much and
invented little. According to Richard Cumberland he was an artist
incapable of portraying either life or death; a painter whose creations
neither terrify nor inspire passion or transport; a timid, conscientious
craftsman with an excellent hand for miniature. Yet Mengs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> the ‘Spanish
David,’ as we are told by José de Madrazo, was regarded by the youth of
his time as ‘the regenerator of the antique,’ and from the dictatorial
chair of pictorial art, his voice ‘was heard like that of an oracle, not
so much by the artistic cohorts of agitated Germany, where he received
little attention, as by the peaceful Italo-Spanish pleiades, who
applauded with enthusiasm the exhumation of the Hellenic form from among
the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii, because it was the fashion, and
without comprehending the reach of that fortuitous event.’</p>

<p>In the fantastic, beautiful, but slightly handled compositions of
Battista Tiepolo we have the reaction against this form of classicism.
The Venetian possessed a fertile and brilliant fancy, his execution was
free and daring, if at times careless, and, in addition, he had a wide
knowledge of the resources of his art. His decorations in the new palace
at Madrid were ‘extolled to the skies of a generation that had forgotten
Velazquez.’ Tiepolo got his effects rapidly; Mengs was laborious to a
fault, but his work was probably a better guide for second-rate
painters, themselves poorly equipped in knowledge, than the clearly
(though incorrectly) drawn com<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span>positions of his Venetian contemporary.
As director of the Académia de San Fernando, Mengs suggested several new
laws for the government of the students and certain alterations in the
methods of study. These were at first adopted, but in carrying them into
effect the director seems to have met with opposition and involved
himself in quarrels, which ‘did little credit to the wisdom of his
fellow-directors, or to his own temper and tact.’ As a result of these
dissensions Mengs failed to accomplish all his reforms, but he secured
several important changes in the Academy. It was due to his efforts that
plaster casts were taken of the statues discovered at Herculaneum.
Charles <small>III.</small> dowered the institution with a rich collection of marbles
and bronzes which had been presented to his Majesty by Mengs, and he
supplemented this gift with a large number of statues and busts from the
Museum of Cristina of Sweden, and with pictures from the royal galleries
and from the suppressed houses of the Jesuits. The sovereign also formed
a library for the Academy, opened a school of perspective (Royal Decree
of August 19, 1766), and commissioned the surgeon Augustin Navarro to
instruct the students in the science of nature and the human form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p>In his efforts on behalf of the Academy, Mengs had the loyal assistance
of Francisco Bayeu and Mariano Maëlla. The latter’s pictures are
deficient in invention, in vigour of execution, and in variety; indeed
his cold pearl-coloured creations have nothing to compensate their
feeble and unimpressive handling and colour. Bayeu was gifted with
peculiar intelligence and as an artist displayed fertility, capacity in
composing a picture, and a skilful touch, but his designs lack vigour
and delicacy, and his colour is disagreeable.</p>

<p>When Goya reappeared in Madrid in 1775, Mengs was dictator of art, and
Bayeu was the Court painter. Goya’s art owed nothing to contemporary
influence or example, but to these two officials he was indebted for
employment and for his wife. The young Aragonese knew nothing of the
bitterness of long apprenticeship; his rise in the esteem of the art
world of Madrid was rapid. This, in a measure, was due to his genius,
but his worldly prospects were assisted by his marriage to Josefa Bayeu,
the sister of the Court painter, and by the influence of Mengs, which
secured for him a commission to execute a series of designs for the
tapestries woven at the Fábrica de Tapices de Santa Bárbara. This first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span>
series were designed for the decoration of the dining-room and
bed-chamber of the Prince of the Asturias in the Palace of El Pardo.
Goya delivered the first picture on October 31, 1776; on January 26,
1778, the tenth and last cartoon was delivered.</p>

<p>Between 1776 and 1791 Goya executed the forty-six tapestry cartoons
which now hang in the Prado, and he repainted many of his designs on a
smaller scale for the Countess of Benavente at the Alameda. As late as
1802 the Santa Bárbara factory wove tapestries from Goya’s pictures, and
up to 1832 some of the more favoured designs had been reproduced four
times. Isabella <small>II.</small> presented some of these fabrics to King Leopold of
Belgium, but the greater number adorn the royal palaces of Madrid, El
Pardo, and the Escorial.</p>

<p>The designs for tapestries which Goya composed during this period of
over twenty-five years form a large part of the painter’s artistic
output. It has been said that these early designs do not exhibit any of
the painter’s predominant characteristics, and that they reveal
crudeness and uncertainty. It is probable that Goya approached the task,
in the first place, with very little knowledge of either the industry or
the style<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span> of design required from him. Mr. Rothenstein remarks that the
models in the Prado are painted ‘in so crude a key, and with so little
regard for harmony of colouring, that their merit is apt to escape the
attention of many students,’ while the strong reds and yellows Goya
employs in them have prompted Mr. Muther to compare them unfavourably
with the ‘tender delicate colouring’ of Watteau and Lancret. Certainly
Goya’s designs are unequal in merit. It must be remembered, too, that
often he had not the good fortune of being reproduced faithfully; while
other artists employed by the factory gained much by reproduction, his
work almost invariably suffered in the process. The officials at the
factory objected to the elaborate and delicate work which Goya
submitted, and a beautiful model (‘The Blind Man playing the Guitar’)
was returned to him on the ground that it could not be successfully
transferred to the threads of the warp. Goya corrected his design by
exaggerating all the tints and he accentuated the figures by enclosing
them in white outlines. This fact suggests one reason why Goya’s
enthusiasm in the employment speedily grew cool.</p>

<p>We learn from the Palace archives that the officials, who were more
concerned with the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span>mercial than the artistic side of the
manufacture, declared that Goya’s figures were ‘dandies and girls with
so much decoration of coifs, ribbons, fal-lals, gauzes, etc., that much
time and patience is wasted on them, and the work is unproductive.’ They
contrived to remedy this defect by covering his figures with paintings
of trees or clouds or anything else that made the tapestry easier and
cheaper to produce, and this treatment was not calculated to make Goya
more careful in the finish of his designs. It therefore follows of
necessity that only occasionally among his later cartoons can one be
found to compare with those in the first series, such, for instance, as
‘The Picnic on the Banks of the Manzanares’ and ‘The Dance at San
Antonio de la Florida,’ or indeed with any of the earlier designs, which
were all remarkable for the vigour and animation of the scenes, the
delicacy of colouring (despite an occasional surfeit of sienna and red
ochre), the strength and freedom of the drawing, and the genius for
natural and effective grouping in the composition of the pictures. Goya
would appear in these works to be carried away by his imagination, and
he has presented to us a masterly panorama of all that is brightest and
most joyous in the national customs&mdash;a panorama<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> that pulsates with
life, bubbles over with spontaneous merriment, and fascinates with its
irresistible gaiety. We seem to hear the bells of the pony chaise and
the pleasant jokes of the wenches at the fêtes on the banks of the
Manzanares; the farces of Ramón de la Cruz are translated into the
language of colour. And the pictures with children&mdash;happy, roguish
youngsters&mdash;reveal not only marvellous skill, but a sympathy with the
poetry and charm of childhood that has not been surpassed. Zapater tells
us that Goya was often seen surrounded by children in his house by the
Manzanares, and his whole-hearted love of childish grace and innocence
is manifested in these studies.</p>

<p>Among his later work as a designer of tapestry one of the best examples
is ‘The Earthenware Stall,’ which in its delicacy of colouring, its
skilful arrangement of transparent draperies, and its brilliant
lighting, is comparable with ‘The Village Wedding,’ which Cruzada
declares to be the most graceful composition of the whole collection.
Here the story is told with supreme humour. The stupid and happy youth
in his finest attire walks beside his fresh-coloured bride who is
bedecked with finery and ribbons, a priest and the parents and friends
of the young couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> accompany them, and the village piper marches in
front surrounded by a crowd of singing, shouting, dancing children. In
beauty of colouring this design is the equal of the handsome, graceful
figures in ‘The Water-Girls,’ and in its mirthfulness and realism it is
a companion to his illustration of ‘Blind Man’s Buff,’ which overflows
with irrepressible merriment. Another notable design which is also the
largest that Goya painted, is ‘El Agosto,’ a striking piece of work. ‘On
contemplating this picture,’ writes the Conde de la Viñaza&mdash;who declares
that it entitles Goya to be known as the Theocritus, the Virgil, and the
Garcilaso of painting&mdash;‘the sun seems to burn and asphyxiate with its
fire, the reapers appear to be dazed with wine, and we seem to hear the
chirping of a cricket hidden in the sheaves. Of the children crying and
playing on the hills of straw, some appear to be the children of Van
Dyck, and others the work of the expressive hand that created the
weeping Ganymede.’</p>

<p>The forty-six cartoons mentioned in the Prado catalogue&mdash;of which
thirty-three are reproduced at the end of this volume&mdash;are now contained
in the Goya Room of the Madrid Gallery. During the reign of Isabella
<small>II.</small>, Frederico de Madrazo, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> director of the Royal Gallery,
repeatedly importuned the administrators of the Royal Patrimony to
exhume the Goya designs from the cellars of the Tapestry offices to
which they had been consigned, and to have them restored and housed in
the Royal Museum. This request, however, was not conceded, and it
remained for Gregorio Cruzada Villaamil to rescue them from the oblivion
into which they had fallen. He succeeded in having the cartoons placed
at the disposal of the Escorial Tapestry Museum Commission, and after
being restored they were sent to the Prado. Unfortunately the works are
difficult to restore and quickly deteriorate; for it was Goya’s practice
to sketch his pictures with extraordinary rapidity, to surround the
whole with carbon, and then trace his figures with the aid of <i>aqua
rás</i>. Many of the studies in the Prado are covered with glass in order
to preserve from total loss the canvases on which scarcely any oil has
been used beyond that contained in the colours.</p>

<p>During these first years of his material prosperity Goya varied his work
for the tapestry factory by producing <i>genre</i> paintings and a few
portraits. He also began at this time to exercise his extraordinary
powers as an engraver. As an exponent of <i>genre</i> he was unsurpassed, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span>
a portraitist he was excelled by Velazquez alone, but his genius is more
certainly demonstrated in his <i>aquafortis</i> work than in either his
<i>genre</i> studies, his frescoes, or his portraits. ‘Goya was pre-eminently
fitted, both by his environment and by his nature,’ writes C. Gasquoine
Hartley, ‘to be the exponent of <i>genre</i>.’ The truth of this dictum is
patent to all who study his canvases of this period. The customs that he
depicted were the customs that he loved; the subjects, the people, and
the passions represented are always real. He reveals both imagination
and invention in the grouping and arrangement of the scenes. The vigour
and boldness of his manner is revealed in the success with which he
seizes, as with a camera, the fleeting movement&mdash;the unfinished smile,
the arrested gesture&mdash;and seals it upon his canvas. His scenes of
carnival and of merry-makings, his representations of bull-fights, and
his sidelights on the Inquisition, are living phases of the life which
surrounded him and in which he found his pleasure and his inspiration.
The spirit of Goya is in all these pictures. His dramatic temperament,
his fierce humour, and his imagination found their outlet in the life of
the period and expressed itself in these paintings in which that life is
immortalised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

<p>In all that he painted Goya never lost sight of, if he did not always
attain, his object of securing absolute truth of effect. Whether he is
employed on a portrait, a representation of romance or <i>diablerie</i>, or a
religious fresco, he is true to the principle explained in his own
remark that ‘a picture is finished when its effect is true.’ And the
truth of ‘his flashes of insight imprisoned in line and paint,’ give his
work a sense of modernity which is seen in the pictures of few other
artists. M. Paul Lefond declares: ‘More than any other painter of past
periods he is made to be understood in our day. Something more and
something better than a modern, the Aragon painter still remains a
forerunner; he is still almost a contemporary of the generation to come.
His manner of translating and interpreting nature is absolutely modern.
He renders it as he sees it, with the comprehension of an artist of our
time, daring and independent. He is more than a hundred years in advance
of his century. His manner of portrait-painting is completely outside
all theory of teaching; his fashion of treating frescoes is an
extraordinary audacity. He has in his whole existence, without truce or
compromise, been pursued by this idea of arriving at the true expression
of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span>’</p>

<p>It has been claimed for Goya that his genius was arrogantly
unsubjective; that he had no master and was contemptuous of all rules.
Originality and independence could go no further, and it may be admitted
that he was intolerant of outside influence. But the spark of genius
must be fanned into flame by the magnetic influence of example, and
while Goya studied nature with a passionate and jealous devotion, he
glories in the debt he owes to Rembrandt and Velazquez. ‘I have had
three masters,’ he wrote to a literary friend, ‘Nature, Velazquez, and
Rembrandt.’ Some have tried to recognise in him a disciple of Tiepolo,
and his study of the aquafortis engravings of the Venetian may well have
suggested his adoption of that so long neglected method of engraving,
but as we should expect, he preserved an independent attitude of mind
and developed a manner quite different from that of Tiepolo. There is no
evidence, in his engravings, of any admiration for Tiepolo’s style, but
his admiration of Rembrandt was as sincere as was his devotion to
Velazquez. Gautier finds that Goya’s work reminds one of Velazquez and
Rembrandt, ‘as a son reminds you of his ancestors, without any servile
imitation&mdash;or rather, more by certain congeniality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> taste than by any
formal wish.’ ‘Goya’s love for the old masters,’ says Lafond, ‘is the
best proof one can give of his sincerity. He did not think of inventing
new processes; conscious that the same language is capable of a variety
of expressions, he was content to master the technique of the past and
to borrow from it all that best suited his individuality.’ But what he
borrowed he moulded and modified to suit his own purposes; translating
it into a language which was his own and in the process enlarging it
with new and further life.</p>

<p>In 1779 Goya presented to the King his plates after the pictures of
Velazquez. This series, which consisted of the portraits of Philip <small>III.</small>,
Philip <small>IV.</small>, Margaret of Austria, Isabella of Bourbon, Prince Baltasar
Carlos, the Count-Duke of Olivarez, and other etchings, are faithful
though not inspired copies of the master. Goya wrote to Zapater that he
had had the honour of being received by his Majesty and family when he
submitted the plates for their inspection, and he adds, ‘I could not
have wished them to be more pleased than they showed themselves to be on
seeing them.’</p>

<p>Herr Valerian von Loga, who has an intimate acquaintance with and
profound knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span> of Goya’s etchings and lithographs, has just
published in Berlin a series of thirty-two reproductions of the rarest
examples of the painter’s work in these media. The explanatory notes
which accompany the plates are of great interest both to the student and
the collector. This writer assumes that José del Castillo, who worked
with Goya for the tapestry factory of Santa Bárbara, urged him to devote
some of his restless activity to the etching needle. He holds that in
his earlier attempts, and particularly in ‘The Flight into Egypt,’ the
technique reminds one of Tiepolo. This etching is the work of an
apprentice hand, and while it is not devoid of charm, it runs on bad
lines. Goya’s acquaintance with the fundamental rules of etching was so
imperfect that, in the first prints of his ‘St. Francisco de Paula,’ the
inscription C. A. R. J. appears turned the wrong way. It is the opinion
of Herr Valerian von Loga that in almost all the plates executed at this
period there is a certain emptiness and unsteadiness of drawing, while
the unsuccessful handling of light and shade betrays the work of the
beginner, but ‘what is new and original, and above all, characteristic
of Goya, is the manner in which the whole is worked out according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span>
the painter’s mode of working. We see the artist taking pains, not to
give form to the things themselves, but to their appearance. On this
account outlines are omitted and contours left open, and there are no
regularly-growing, flowing lines, while parallel and crossing strokes
are rare. The dark surfaces are composed of a great number of short,
chopped-off strokes; the entire workmanship is nervous and undecided. It
is clear here that the ability of the artist was far behind the
good-will, and at times too his inspiration was insufficient.’</p>

<p>In his copies of Velazquez Goya appears to have been the first to
introduce into Spain Le Prince’s ten-year-old process of aquatinta, a
process which in later times he developed to the highest perfection. In
1779 he brought out an etching from one of his own designs for the
tapestry factory. His work so pleased the Prince of the Asturias, for
whom it was executed, that the painter is credited with an intention of
publishing all his Santa Bárbara pictures as etchings. But his growing
popularity as a portrait painter now claimed his activities for more
remunerative work, and for more than ten years he laid aside the etching
needle in favour of the brush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span></p>

<p>We learn from a memorial preserved in the Palace Archives that the
graciousness of his reception, the success of his tapestry designs, and
the admiration that Charles <small>III.</small> had expressed for his two religious
studies of ‘Christ Crucified’ and of ‘St. Francis,’ emboldened the
artist to proffer himself for the position of Court Painter. This honour
was denied, but he was elected a member of the Académia de San Fernando.</p>

<p>On January 24, 1781, Goya left Madrid for Zaragoza to assist in the
redecoration of the Church del Pilar under the direction of his
brother-in-law, Francisco Bayeu. The dissensions which arose out of this
commission between Bayeu and Goya, and between Goya and the Building
Committee, were bitter and prolonged. It is not likely that the
biographers of Goya, without the facts of the dispute to guide them to a
correct conclusion, would display much sympathy with a conventional,
mediocre painter like Bayeu, or so nebulous a body as an archbishop’s
chapter, and Zapater and Cruzada have revealed their hero in the light
of a persecuted, long-suffering martyr. The vanity and envy of Bayeu and
the wilful obstinacy of the Building Committee in their support of the
older artist they hold to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> have been at the bottom of the matter. But
the Conde de la Viñaza has exhumed the hard facts in the archives of the
Pilar Cathedral, and from these it is now clear that the indomitable
independence of Goya’s nature and his impetuous intolerance of all
restriction have not been taken sufficiently into account by his
biographers.</p>

<p>From the documents which Viñaza has brought to light we learn that the
frescoes which Bayeu completed in the Pilar Church, in 1776, gave so
much satisfaction to the authorities that they agreed to the artist’s
terms for painting the round vaults and cupolas of the church. Four
years later, when the Building Committee were getting impatient for the
work to be put in hand, they granted Bayeu permission to engage his
brother Ramon and his brother-in-law Goya to assist in the execution of
the designs which he had already prepared. On October 5, 1780, Ramon
Bayeu and Goya presented these designs for the vaults. The Committee
found that they were ‘inspired by the greatest taste’ and decided to
proceed at once with the work. It may be assumed that Francisco Bayeu
arrived shortly after to supervise the operations of his assistants, and
it was not long before the disagreements between Goya and his
brother-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span> commenced. On December 14 Bayeu complained that Goya
would not be subject to correction in the manner of his painting, and he
asked the Committee that he might be relieved of his responsibility in
the direction of the work, in so far as Goya was concerned. We read that
‘the Committee, taking into account that Goya had come to paint, owing
in a great measure to the pressure and eulogy of Bayeu in his letters,
agreed that the Building Director (Canon Allué) should see Goya and his
painting frequently, and mention any defects he might notice and impress
upon him how grateful he ought to be for the good offices of D.
Francisco Bayeu in engaging him as his assistant.’</p>

<p>Although it is evident that Goya was already in revolt against the
supervision which he had accepted as a condition of his employment, the
trouble was temporarily overborne. From this we may conclude that the
good Allué did not insist too much upon the gratitude which Goya owed to
his brother-in-law. By February Goya had completed the painting of the
dome, and he then submitted his studies for the four triangles formed by
the arches supporting it. It would appear that the public had expressed
their dissatisfaction with Goya’s compositions in the dome, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span>
Committee complained that not only were these new designs marked by
similar defects of ‘drapery, colouring, and idea,’ but one of the
figures represented came short of the standard of chastity that was
required in pictures of this kind. The Committee, ‘fearing to expose
themselves to fresh censure and an accusation of negligence and want of
care, put this matter, by reason of the confidence he had won from the
Committee and from the whole chapter, under the direction and in the
hands of D. Francisco Bayeu, hoping that he will take the trouble to see
these studies and say whether the observations of the Committee are just
in deciding that the triangles be painted in such a way that they may be
shown to the public without fear of criticism.’ But when this resolution
of the Committee was communicated to Bayeu, he retaliated with a tirade
upon his offended dignity, and we find Allué appealing to Goya to ‘see
if there be any way of arranging the matter, knowing that the Committee
desire harmony, and do not wish to expose their conduct to censure, but
desire only that the work be skilful and perfect.’</p>

<p>To this appeal Goya returned what we may describe as a characteristic
letter. This epistle has been published in Spain, but no transla<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span>tion
has hitherto appeared in England. The letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3><span class="smcap">Memorial of Goya to the Building Committee.</span></h3>

<p>D. Francisco de Goya, Member of the Royal Academy of San Fernando,
respectfully shows: That after having put the works of his
profession before the public, namely, the paintings just unveiled
at the Church of Our Lady of Pilar, his attention had been called
to the opinions he hears expressed, containing a criticism prompted
by a principle other than that of justice, or governed by the
authorised rules of art, which only should form the opinion
regarding the work; and although he cannot believe that ill-meant
prejudice has gained access to your rectitude, or that you could be
led away by impulses little in accord with reason; yet the honour
of a professor is a very delicate thing; opinion is what sustains
him, all his subsistence depends on his reputation, and when that
is obscured by even a light shadow, his fortune is gone; therefore
Nature warns him to take care of it by using all the defences
within his reach, and to omit the least would be to gain a slight
advantage by abandoning the greatest treasure the Creator had
entrusted to him.</p>

<p>These principles, accompanied by a sense of wounded honour, the
expositor hopes his explanation will make evident to your
benignity.</p>

<p>D. Francisco Bayeu asked that the work in the domes might be done
by his brother and the expositor, but it was on the understanding
that the latter should do one of the parts by himself, as Bayeu
himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> agreed, considering that the degree of an honoured member
of the San Fernando Academy, acquired by the work which had won
great renown for him in Madrid, in addition to the work for H.M.,
would not admit of his absolute subordination to another professor
without detriment to his honour. The expositor might be wrong in
this, but his error would have the approbation of D. Francisco
Bayeu himself, who agreed to it, and was a trustworthy witness of
the success that might be expected; and also that of the chief
Presbyter Allué, to whom through some people in the city he had
manifested the same opinion, to which he agreed.</p>

<p>The expositor feeling sure of said promises, with all good faith in
them, proceeded with the Study or Design, and as he wished to be on
good terms with D. Francisco Bayeu he took it to him, and received
his entire approval: he came with him to this city: he began his
work by consulting him regarding the place where the principal
façade should be put; the expositor gave way to Bayeu’s opinion. He
presented the design to you, who approved them; and in executing
them he has only enlarged them.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration these harmonious dealings of the
supplicant with D. Francisco Bayeu, which created no motive for
resentment, and were governed by the principles and rules
prescribed in the first and only conversations regarding the
matter, who could think that the expositor had been wanting in
respect to Bayeu? There are those who think so, because when the
work was well in hand, they wished to make him understand that the
agreement with Bayeu was that he should interfere as much as he
liked with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span> expositor’s work, and that the latter should obey
him as a subordinate in execution, placing of figures, style,
colouring, and so forth; in a word make him a mere executor and
mercenary subordinate; but as this was in direct opposition to what
had been agreed, it would have been discreditable to his honour to
yield, as he would be losing what his merit had won for him, and he
could not therefore so humiliate himself, for he knew that the
previous offices were sufficient, and that similar ones if
continued would not make them anything but his own production. D.
Francisco Bayeu’s warning to you that he would not be responsible
for his part of the work, only shows that his object was to create
a want of confidence that should cause coercion to be exercised,
which was justly resisted, for doubt as to skill and success sat
ill on D. Francisco, who knew quite well of the honours acquired by
the expositor in Madrid, both from the Royalties and from all who
had seen his productions, all executed by himself without the
slightest direction from any one.</p>

<p>After this, things were artfully circulated against the conduct of
the expositor, concerning his temper, proceedings and dealings with
Bayeu, he being accused of hauteur, pride and stubbornness.
Thereafter malice prepared the blow, long premeditated, of first
creating personal disaffection, and then disaffection with his
work; as shown by the reception of his work in the dome of the
Cathedral of Our Lady. The criticism passed by some persons can
only be attributed to this, because all its merit is unobserved and
only the defects suggested by caprice or ignorance are sought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<p>He has suffered with resignation the insults to his honour, he has
had the patience to see that the same Bayeu who impaired his credit
with insinuating words, and the deceitful complaint that he was
responsible for the success of the work, and that he would have to
give an account of the confidence placed in him, and that the
supplicant was depriving him of this satisfaction because he would
not allow him to correct or alter his productions; on other
occasions defended the expositor, exalting his merit, acknowledging
his skill and the correctness of his painting.</p>

<p>The insinuations of Bayeu have led to the conclusion that the
expositor came to this city as a mere subordinate of his, and that
notwithstanding this absolute dependence, his proud spirit would
not submit to asking for instructions from D. Francisco, even on
the ground of friendship and relationship. Two entirely false
propositions, which are the cause of all the supplicant’s trouble,
because regarding the first he has already told you about the
agreements that preceded his coming to Zaragoza, and regarding this
and the second, D. Francisco Bayeu cannot deny that, as the result
of those agreements, the expositor executed the studies and designs
in Madrid, showed them to him, received his approval, and no fault
was found. The studies are the complete work, with the same
figures, colouring and arrangement to be observed, and the work
itself an entire copy of them; and if they passed his examination
in Madrid as an act of condescension on the part of the supplicant,
emanating from his desire for peace, why, if as he says he was
responsible, did he not then point out the defects he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span> might have
noted? He did not do so; then what is to be inferred from his
having concealed them, if he noticed them? Obviously, and no
dissimulating artifice can hide this, it may be gathered that his
object was for the expositor to be in error, receive indignant
public censure, and lose all the merit and status won by his work.
But not wishing to believe such malevolence, because other proofs
would be required of it, it must be admitted either that he found
no defects in the studies or designs, and therefore the painting on
the dome, which is the same, has none, or that D. Francisco was
most culpable who, knowing of them, said nothing and allowed them
to be copied.</p>

<p>The expositor has never departed from that friendly subordination,
nor attempted to oppose D. Francisco Bayeu with the proud spirit of
which he is accused; a proof of this is what has been said about
the designs; another, the placing of the principal façade; and,
lastly, the many visits he paid him at his own house, even though
they were not returned. On being informed that the Chapter wished
Bayeu to inspect the work on the dome, he arranged for him to do
so, which he did, accompanied by the chief Presbyter Allué, and in
his presence admitted and acknowledged the perfection of the work,
saying that what he had been informed was not true; he also saw the
designs for the triangles, and approved of them.</p>

<p>In face of all this, the expositor finds that the same bitter
opposition which he had thought would cease, still continued,
because the sense of truth may be suspended but not extinguished,
but seeing that there is no hope of staying the torrent of
provocations that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span> insult his honour and fame, and that an honoured
professor cannot stand for ever against the opposition of his
enemies, whose only object is to work him ill; notwithstanding that
he thought he must finish the work on the triangles, he has at last
been undeceived by the letter which the chief Presbyter Allué had
just sent to him, of which he sends you a complete copy. After the
calumnies he has had to endure, the slights and contempt with which
he is treated will not permit him to continue to expose himself to
some greater misfortune. He now humbly shows, and at the same time
sets forth that he has heard that some figures were to be altered
in the dome, and although the expositor cannot be sure that you
will allow yourselves to be guided by the declamatory voice of the
ignorant public, or the opinion of rivals, the right he has to
defend his honour leads him to forestall you. Before a daub is put
in the Church that will obscure and deprive it of merit, and leave
a permanent witness of the ignorance which is a reproach: which is
now the only thing in the matter that interests him, and regarding
which he appeals to you&mdash;because the will of the owner in his own
house does not let go the reins of liberty to such an extent,
merely in order to exercise his authority, as to permit without
cause, and quite uselessly, great detriment to another on a point
so delicate as honour&mdash;the expositor thinks the best way to appease
the want of confidence he presumes in others and to assert his own
opinion, is that a person expert in the art, authorised in his
profession, and whose opinion would be impartial, should minutely
inspect the work, and when his criticism detects his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> unskilfulness
and error, or testifies to his sufficiency and skill, he will watch
with indifference any mutilations executed. Therefore he humbly
begs that you will arrange for the work in the dome to be seen by
one of the members of the San Fernando Academy, one of the most
renowned, as D. Mariano Maëlla or D. Antonio Velazquez, at the
expense of the expositor, and after careful inspection his
declaration be accepted as testimony.&mdash;Zaragoza, March 17, 1781.</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Francisco de Goya.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Upon the receipt of this letter, which may be left to speak for itself,
the worthy and sorely tried Allué seems to have invited the mediation of
Father Salzedo, who was, perhaps, the only man to whom the irascible
Goya might be expected to listen. Salzedo wrote the painter a long,
earnest epistle, in which he appealed to his better judgment and
prudence, cited instances of humility in the life of Christ for his
guidance, and demonstrated the practical advantages that would be
derived from doing his work to the satisfaction of the Building
Committee. The good father did not hesitate to tell his friend that he
had taken up a wrong attitude towards his brother-in-law and the
Cathedral authorities, and plainly exhorted him ‘with all generosity and
Christian charity, to submit your studies to Bayeu’s opinion, in order
to please God by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> humility, edify the public, and give pleasure to
your friends.’ And he adds in conclusion: ‘My dictum, as your greatest
admirer, is that you submit to the demands of the Committee, have your
studies taken to your brother’s house, and say to him in the best manner
possible: This is required by the Chapter&mdash;here they are; examine them
to your satisfaction, and put your opinion in writing, doing this as God
and your conscience shall dictate, etc. And then await the result.’</p>

<p>The foregoing letter was dated March 30, 1781. On April 6, Goya wrote a
conciliatory note to Allué, promising to make fresh studies in
consultation with Bayeu. Eleven days later the Committee approved the
new designs and expressed their pleasure at finding him reconciled to
his brother-in-law. But the truce, for such one supposes it to have
been, did not last. From a minute in the report of the Building
Committee’s proceedings on May 28, it is recorded that Goya, in a ‘not
very courteous’ manner, had told Allué that he was only losing his
reputation in Zaragoza and desired permission to return to Madrid as
soon as possible: ‘The Committee resenting this further affront,
resolved: First, that the Professor be paid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> his painting. Second,
that under no circumstances would he be permitted to continue to paint
any more in this Church, but that this need not deter the Director from
giving some medals to his wife, in virtue of her being the sister of D.
Francisco Bayeu, who was so worthy of this and other considerations from
the Committee, by reason of his skilful work in this church.’</p>

<p>The source of the trouble was the failure of the Committee to accept
Goya at his own estimate, which was certainly the true one, as the
superior of Bayeu. The young painter doubtless did his best to follow
the advice of Father Salzedo, but he wore the robes of humility with a
bad grace, and was impatient of ignorant and pedantic criticism. His
position had become untenable. The painter received his payment, his
wife accepted her medals, and they left Zaragoza for Madrid in June
1781.</p>

<p>Goya was indulging no empty boast when he intimated, in his memorial to
the Building Committee, that his renown in Madrid was widely
acknowledged. He was no sooner back in the capital than the Conde de
Florida Blanca sent him a royal order to paint one of the pictures for
the Church of San Francisco el Grande. The favoured minister also
presented him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> Infante don Luis, the brother of the King and
husband of Maria Teresa Vallabriga, who at once conceived a great liking
for the painter. He spent a month at the palace of Arenas de San Pedro,
and was entertained with great hospitality, while he executed portraits
of the Infante’s family. He also painted for the Consejo de las Ordenes
several devotional pictures for the Calatrava College at the Salamanca
University. In his leisure hours he worked at his picture in the Church
of St. Francis. This work was not completed until November 1784. The
pictures were ceremoniously unveiled on the 8th of December, in the
presence of the King and his court. The occasion was a triumph for Goya.
Other pictures had been painted by Bayeu, Mariano Maëlla, Gregorio
Farro, Antonio Velazquez, Joseph del Castillo, and Andres Calleja. But
their work was eclipsed by the composition in which the magic brush of
the Aragonese represented San Bernardino de Siena. The saint is shown
with a crucifix in his hand, standing on a rock, preaching, by the light
of a brilliant star, to the wonder-filled King Alfonso of Aragon and his
court.</p>

<p>Great was the admiration which this picture won for the artist, but, as
was usual in Spain, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> experienced much difficulty in obtaining payment
for his work. In April 1785 we find Goya, Farro, and Castillo
memorialising the Conde de Florida Blanca for pecuniary acknowledgment
of their labours, explaining that they had each spent two years in
making sketches and studies and in the execution of their several
pictures, and pointing out that they are obliged to gain their
livelihood with their work and ‘have no income or assistance, like
others who have the good fortune to serve his Majesty.’ This memorial
was despatched with a covering letter from Antonio Ponz, who emphasises
the fact that the painters are in need, and hopes that their request
will be complied with, ‘in order that these poor men may not lose heart
and that reward shall hearten them to fresh work.’ Three months late
Florida Blanca arranged with the general directors at the post-office to
hand the artists ‘six thousand reals for the present until something
else is arranged.’ This payment is duly noted on the memorial, and a
later marginal order, presumably in the Count’s handwriting, reads: ‘Pay
another 4000 reals to each, although the pictures are nothing wonderful,
but theirs are the best.’ This grudging eulogy was in striking contrast
with the enthusiastic praise bestowed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span> Goya’s pictures for the
Salamanca College by the Consejo de las Ordenes, who instructed
Jove-Llanos to assure the artist that he was ‘singularly satisfied with
the care and diligence with which he had finished the paintings and with
their eminent merit.’</p>

<p>In the year of his return to Madrid Goya’s father died, and the painter
sent for his mother and his brother Camilo to join him. He obtained for
Camilo a chaplainship at Chinchón, but his mother soon wearied of the
unaccustomed noise and bustle of the city and retired to Zaragoza, where
she lived on a pension of five reals per diem provided by Goya. The
artist at this time may have found some difficulty in providing for his
household; for his family, if not long-lived, was numerous, but it is
unlikely that he ever felt the pinch of poverty. We can well believe
that he was insistent in obtaining the reward of his labours, especially
when he was working for princes who, in his view, were living a life of
gilded pauperism, and the stress which Ponz lays upon the needs of these
‘poor men’ is far removed from the attitude assumed by Goya. In the
letter, in which he applies for payment, he does not plead for a dole in
relief of his poverty, but demands the remuneration which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span> is justly due
to him. This is the only recorded instance of his being in financial
straits. From this time his career is one of eventful and interrupted
but assured success. Fame and fortune attended him on either hand. In
1785 Andreas Calleja died, and Goya succeeded him as deputy director of
the Academy of San Fernando, with an annual salary of twenty-five
doubloons. Four years later, on the death of Cornelio van der Goten,
Charles <small>IV.</small>, who had just succeeded his father Charles <small>III.</small>, appointed
him a Painter of the Chamber, with a salary of 15,000 reals, which was
increased in 1799 to 50,000 reals a year, with the rank of first painter
to the King.</p>

<p>In this period of his greatest prosperity, Goya was courted not only for
the sake of his art, but also for his personal qualities. He was popular
with men, while women eagerly contended for his favour. A revolutionary,
he became the friend of the King, while the Queen and the Countess of
Benavente delighted in his companionship. He went from palace to palace
and from fête to fête, observing, working, studying, revelling in the
life by which he was surrounded and in which he played a full part. This
lover of freedom could breathe in an atmosphere of corruption; this son
of the soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span> could play the courtier with a will. ‘If we are to
understand his genius rightly,’ says C. Gasquoine Hartley, in <i>A Record
of Spanish Painting</i>, ‘all contradictions are solved when we realise
that he was an onlooker at, rather than an operator in, many incidents
of his life.’ This half-hearted attempt to condone the irregularity of
his life at this period is at variance both with what we know of Goya’s
temperament and with the facts. He was an actor as well as an
interpreter of the scenes which he represents, and many of his pictures,
which are regarded as biting satires of the follies and vice of his age,
are quite as plausibly explained as the expression of personal animus
and party feeling. Certain people have discovered in Goya a moralist
after the style of Hogarth, using his brush in the sacred cause of
morality, to expose the vices of his time, laying bare the baseness of
his contemporaries in order to inspire contempt and horror of their
conduct, stigmatising the habits of the court of Charles <small>IV.</small>, and
castigating the hypocrisy, ignorance, and immodesty of the men and women
who surrounded the royal family. But while in the later works of his
mature age he employed his brush and needle to this purpose, it is more
probable, as Lafond<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> concludes, that under Charles <small>IV.</small> and Maria Luisa,
Goya drew and engraved, as La Fontaine wrote his fables: for the
pleasure of producing them, from the necessity of multiplying them, not
troubling himself about questions of morality or of the lessons which
his pictures should teach. ‘The truth is,’ says his French biographer,
‘that, mixed up in the intrigues of the Court and involved in personal
quarrels, he takes the part now of one, now of another, using his pen to
scratch his adversaries of to-day who are his allies to-morrow.’ In all
his works he imbued the subject with the quality of his thought as well
as with the charm of his colour and the skill of his draughtmanship. Of
all the artists of his class, says the <i>Boletin de la Sociedad Española
de Excursiones</i>, none put into their studies more meaning and personal
opinion. If he painted a scene he attached to it a proverb or a
significant ejaculation; if he produced a portrait he left upon the
likeness his opinion of his model; if in many cases it amounted to a
positive caricature, he could no more help seeing his subject in that
guise than his subject could avoid so appearing to the artist.</p>

<p>With regard to Goya’s personal life at this period it is not necessary
to say much, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span> would seem to have been consistent with our
knowledge of him and of his surroundings. Lafond reminds us that his
wife bore him twenty children and continued to love him in spite of his
endless infidelities. Mr. Rotherstein declares that while it would be
idle to pretend that he was faithful to his wife, it is undeniable that
he was deeply attached to her during her lifetime. With the single
exception of his devotion to the unfortunate Duchess of Alba, says the
same writer, his intrigues seem to have been as much caprices on the
part of his sitters as his own. But these caprices were, as it has been
said, endless. ‘We have only to look at the master’s self-portrait,’
writes Richard Muther, ‘at this man with the bull-neck and full, sensual
lips, to understand that the countless stories which got about on the
subject of his relations with the women of high society in Madrid were
not all inventions of the fancy. Goya must have been a terror to all
their husbands. In all the most aristocratic salons the women were at
his feet; and perhaps they appreciated the difference between this
sturdy man of the people and their decadent lords and masters. In a
word, Goya at this time not only painted Rococo, but lived himself to
its full the wild passionate life<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> of that Rococo period.’ And again, in
the <i>Boletin de la Sociedad Española de Excursiones</i>, we get the shrewd
and common-sense conclusion that ‘Goya was a man of his age. He neither
aspired to the category of an ascetic nor opposed the customs and
tendencies of his time, and his age being one of transition, without
fixed principles, he accommodated himself to its duties and its
weaknesses, never for a moment failing in his domestic obligations, yet
not refusing those outside favours that presented themselves to him.’</p>

<p>It would have been strange indeed if Goya had resisted the temptations
by which he was surrounded; it is remarkable under the circumstances
that he remained unspoiled. The King, as we have seen, was his friend,
the Queen confided to him her most delicate secrets, the all-powerful
Prince de la Pax made him welcome at Aranjuez, and the most
distinguished women of the day delighted in entertaining him. Writing to
his friend Zapater about his success at this period, he said: ‘I had
established for myself an enviable mode of life; I no longer danced
attendance in an ante-chamber; if anybody wanted anything of mine he had
to come to me. I was much sought after, but if it was not anybody in a
high position, or to oblige a friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> I worked for none.’ He was a
privileged guest at the palaces of the Marchioness of Santa Cruz and of
San Carlos; Brunetti and the Countess of Benavente fêted him. His
relations with the beautiful and vivacious Duchess of Alba are too well
known to call for more than a passing mention. The artist painted at
least a dozen portraits of the Duchess, in one of which he presents
himself in company with his inamorata. He introduced her piquant
features into the frescoes of San Antonio de la Florida. She is the
model for the nude and clothed Maja which hang in the Prado Museum.
Tradition has it that the clothed Maja was painted to meet the wishes of
the Duke, who expressed a desire to inspect the master’s work. The story
is almost comical to any one who has stood in front of the two pictures.
Nothing but the most conventional views upon the subject of the nude
could make the naked study more offensive in the eyes of a husband than
the one in which the young woman, ‘naked in spite of her dress,’ appears
to challenge the continence of all the St. Anthonys of Christendom.</p>

<p>Of these pictures Mr. Charles Ricketts writes in an illuminating chapter
on <i>The Masterpieces of the Prado</i>: ‘Goya’s two pictures are still
vivacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> and fresh. In “La Maja,” a nude, he has painted the sensuous
waist, the frail arms, the dainty head of the Duchess thrown upon
pillows, contrasting in their gray whiteness with the gleam upon her
flesh. In the other we note the same grace of pose, a more summary
workmanship, touches of colour&mdash;too many perhaps. The Duchess of Alba
(La Maja) reclines on her divan in her rich bolero and white duck
trousers of a toreador or Spanish dandy. We pause, we are astonished and
charmed; we wonder how such a thing was possible. Her beauty and daring
live on the two canvases; this one scandal in the nineteenth century has
endowed the world with those pictures, and they are now in the Prado. So
ends the adventure.’</p>

<p>The scandal which associated Goya’s name with that of the Duchess of
Alba, fanned, it may be suspected, by the jealousy of the Countess of
Benavente, could not be concealed, and by the order of Maria Luisa, the
Duchess was banished in 1795 to the seclusion of her estate at San
Lucar. The painter immediately obtained from the King a prolonged leave
of absence and accompanied her into exile. On the journey to San Lucar
an accident happened to their carriage, and Goya with his characteristic
energy set to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span> work to repair the defect. An iron bar belonging to the
coach was buckled; a fire had to be lighted and the iron made straight.
The heat and the unwonted exertion which the operation entailed was
followed by a chill, and from this chill resulted the deafness which, in
later years, became complete. The Duchess was recalled in the following
year&mdash;this exercise of royal clemency being apparently the only means of
securing the return of the painter to Madrid&mdash;and died in the same year
in the fullness of her exquisite and inspiring beauty.</p>

<p>The period of Goya’s greatest popularity (1780-1800) was the period of
his greatest activity. He was high in the favour of the Court. Much of
his time was absorbed in painting portraits of his royal and
aristocratic patrons. At the same time he never lost touch with the
commonalty, nor his powers to depict, with sympathy and understanding,
the life of the country&mdash;the bustling, laughing, loving, wrangling,
vibrating life he loved and to which, by birth and temperament, he
belonged. It is probable that he was never a courtier at heart. His
effrontery and uncompromising independence, combined with incisive wit
and physical strength, made him at once a singular and incongruous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> but
popular figure in the Court circles, while his frank <i>camaraderie</i> and
his amazing prowess in the national games and feats of strength, and
above all, the boldness and skill of his demeanour in the bull-ring&mdash;in
which he is said to have been the equal of the professional espada&mdash;won
for him the enthusiastic admiration of the hero-worshipping people of
Madrid. He seems to have been at no pains to disguise the real bent of
his nature. The story runs that he would frequently leave the royal
palace to pass the night in the most disreputable taverns and bodegas in
the suburbs of Madrid, drinking, dicing, and merrymaking with the
night-birds of the capital.</p>

<p>But Goya’s artistic output showed no signs of falling off either in
quality or amount, and his marvellous rapidity of workmanship enabled
him to produce an almost incredible number of canvases. In a biography
and review of this size and scope it is not possible to present a
leisured review of his pictures. We must be content with a brief notice
of the more important among them, but the illustrations at the end of
the volume which are produced in such wealth, and which constitute the
chief interest of this book, will speak more eloquently than words. Of
Goya’s methods of painting many stories are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> told, from which it might
be concluded that he employed for the purpose every instrument known to
art with the solitary exception of a brush. Gautier, who declared his
mode to be as eccentric as his talent, has exhausted all the facts and
legends relating to his brush-work (if so it can be called) in the
following vivacious descriptive passage: ‘He kept his colours in tubs,
and applied them to the canvas by means of sponges, brooms, rags, and
everything that happened to be within his reach. He put on his tones
with a trowel, as it were, exactly like so much mortar, and painted
touches of sentiment with large daubs of his thumb. From the fact of his
working in this offhand and expeditious manner, he would cover some
thirty feet of wall in a couple of days. This method certainly appears
somewhat to exceed even the licence accorded to the most impetuous and
fiery genius; the most dashing painters are but children compared to
him. He executed, with a spoon for a brush, a painting of the “Dos de
Mayo,” where some French troops are shooting a number of Spaniards. It
is a work of incredible vigour and fire.’</p>

<p>The vigour and fire which Gautier finds in this picture is to be
observed in varying degree in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span> all Goya’s works. These qualities were
the results of his temperament, which moved him to fling his ideas upon
the canvas before they could escape him, and imbued him with a constant
desire to be rid of them and at work on something else. ‘His whole art,’
says Muther, ‘seems like a bull-fight; for everywhere he sees before him
some red rag, and hurls himself upon it with the fury of the toro.’ Nor
did his sitters escape the consequences of his impetuosity. Many of his
portraits were painted in a day, but the sitting lasted not a few hours
merely but the whole of the day, during which time, Mr. Rothenstein
tells us, ‘Goya, inexorable towards his model, worked in absolute
silence with extraordinary concentration and vigour.’ The same writer
relates, as an example of his nervousness and irritability in his
studio, the story that the Duke of Wellington so exasperated Goya while
he was painting his portrait by passing comments upon his work while the
picture was in progress, that he took a sword from the wall and forced
his noble sitter to beat a retreat from his studio. Other authorities
state that it was with a pair of pistols that he put the English Duke to
flight. After all, the weapon is not a material point in the story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span></p>

<p>A man who worked at this pressure might be expected to develop a
tendency to scamp his work, but while many of Goya’s compositions are
mere sketches, they are all finished according to his theory that ‘a
picture is finished when its effect is true.’ The many compositions Goya
executed for the Countess of Benavente, until recently at the Alameda
Palace, comprised the most representative exhibition of Goya’s genius.
The collection included many pictures painted with exceptional delicacy.
The most important of these pictures, the Romeria de San Isidro, is a
wonderful canvas containing a mass of details which astonish by their
clearness and finish. The ‘Coach attacked by Brigands’ is one example
among many of his skill in catching an instantaneous motion and
transfixing it upon the canvas. Among the Alameda paintings are some
repetitions of the designs for the tapestry factory. The exuberant
gaiety in these pictures is in amazing contrast with the ‘San Bernard’
or the terrifying cartoon of ‘Saturn devouring his Children.’ Goya can
be simple and bizarre, idyllic and grotesque, fascinating and
appalling&mdash;his vitality emphasises every facet of his imagination. The
examples of phases of his many-sided vision are inexhaustible. He makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span>
demons terrible by their humanity, and men and women horrible by their
diabolical sinisterism. He paints you a fête or a funeral, a picnic or a
hanging, with the same facility and artistic assurance; be the mood he
would portray gay or gloomy, the scene brilliant or shuddersome, the
beauty that of a child, a blushing maiden or a dazzling Maja, he never
hesitates, nor does he often come short of success.</p>

<p>In his portraits he is a realist&mdash;versatile, vivid, often unflinching in
his brutality, unsurpassed, when he wills it, in perfection of treatment
and intention. His finish is the fulfilment of his purpose, which has
nothing in common with finish in the sense of elaboration. True, many of
his likenesses are ‘washed in with a certain impatience, almost as if
the painter had tired of his subject’ (C. Gasquoine Hartley, in <i>A
Record of Spanish Painting</i>); true again, the restlessness of his
temperament made him inclined to seize on a characteristic rendering of
pose and feature: but his portraits reflect the idea in his mind; they
express the always very definite something he has to say; the effect is
true and the picture is finished. It was his method to arrange his
canvas, his model and all his accessories, and then remain wrapped in
profound reflection. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span> his study of his model was ended he set to
work, either to materialise his inspiration in a swift realisation of a
personality, or to produce a suave, lingering piece of workmanship which
recalls the refinement of Gainsborough in its elaborate, exquisite
detail.</p>

<p>Goya, by virtue of his portraits, has been rightly acclaimed the
legitimate descendant of Velazquez, and, like the great Court painter of
a previous century, he is a magnificent exception. But the comparison
between the two masters cannot be pushed too far. Velazquez was a
realist to whom the world appeared as a beautiful vision; Goya was a
realist to whom life was always a drama and not infrequently a satiric
melodrama played in the tempo of a farce. Velazquez depicted men and
women at their noblest; Goya, when he was in the mood, detected the
worst that was in them and he exposed it with a flourish. The grandeur
of the times which we discern in the portraits of Velazquez is the
grandeur of the artist’s conception and treatment. The equestrian
effigies of Philip <small>III.</small> and Philip <small>IV.</small> reveal the magnificence and
nobility of conscious kingship which neither of the monarchs possessed;
the royal likenesses convey to us a prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span> which impoverished Spain
did not enjoy under the rule of his kingly sitters. Thus it is curious
to find that some critics, but particularly the Conde de la Viñaza,
should see in Goya’s work a similar determination to idealise and
glorify the characters of his royal patrons. ‘The celebrated canvas of
the family of Charles <small>IV.</small>,’ writes Goya’s latest Spanish biographer,
‘together with the equestrian portraits’&mdash;the composition of which, as
Mr. Rothenstein reminds us, he may well have learned from Velazquez&mdash;‘of
Maria Luisa and her husband, of Ferdinand <small>VII.</small> and Godoy, show forth a
grandeur of mind and intellectual and moral qualities which these people
did not possess. The Godoy represented by Goya as though he were a sort
of Marquis de Pescara, although he never wore his uniform except at sham
fights, recalls the fact that Velazquez also, flattering the ridiculous
vanity of the Count-Duke of Olivarez, painted his portrait in a suit
which was not his own.... Goya painted moral life hyperbolically
idealised in his effigies of the kings, because he was painter to the
Household and protected by the Crown and the Court, although he was
rather the protector of his protectors. In all the other portraits of
statesmen, politicians, literati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span> scientific men, actors,
bull-fighters, priests and artists, Goya harmonised exactly the body and
the mind. How marvellously he caught the faces of the men of great
minds! How beautifully the moral and intellectual qualities of the
person represented are shown!’</p>

<p>A second and more cautious reading of the foregoing passage was required
to convince us that it was written without sarcasm, and was meant to
express a sober estimate of the qualities which the writer discovered in
the pictures referred to. Personal taste, as we have remarked elsewhere,
counts for much in the whole field of art, and in the opinion which is
quoted the Conde de la Viñaza has the field practically to himself.
Nearly all Goya’s critics and admirers are united in their appreciation
of the merciless and remorseless frankness, the pitiless satire, the
mocking, saturnine faithfulness of the likenesses. Sir William
Stirling-Maxwell misses the point of the equestrian portrait of Charles
<small>IV.</small> when he remarks that ‘the poor imbecile king, in the blue uniform
and cocked hat of a colonel of the guards, mounted on a sober brown
charger,’ is ‘an example of the dignity which may be conferred, by a
skilful hand, on the most ordinary features<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> and expression, without
sacrificing the resemblance.’ But who beside Viñaza and Stirling-Maxwell
could detect anything but a burlesque of kingly dignity in this
grandly-uniformed, coarsely-made and coarse-faced Bourbon who sits
‘asthmatic and fat, upon his fat asthmatic horse, with his fat asthmatic
dog’&mdash;a study which moves a German critic to remark, ‘How like a Moloch
he appears, an evil god who has battened upon the life-blood of his
people.’</p>

<p>The portraits of his sensuous, passion-ridden queen are equally
fearless, true even to brutality. Maria Luisa was a courtesan seated
upon the throne of Spain. Velazquez, it has been wisely said, redeemed
the face of Mariana of Austria in his portrait by making her
unapproachable icy pride the keynote in his composition. Goya extenuates
nothing. He shows the queen, <i>décolletée</i> to vulgarity in her insolently
vulgar gown, with gleaming arms and bosom exposed as a snare, which is
watched over by the greedy, hawk-like eyes. It is the woman she was, the
‘woman who loved men better perhaps than she was loved by them,’ the
courtesan that the artist knew and flattered and despised. Of the
picture of the ‘Family of Charles <small>IV.</small>,’ with its fourteen life-size
figures, it has been written that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span> ‘mirrors the hidden merriment with
which Goya recorded the Court history.’ Here is a faithful exposition of
Goya’s estimate of the Spanish royal family; an estimate which has never
been so remorselessly expressed by any other delineator of royal groups.
They are depicted in their resplendent uniforms and rich gowns, they
have all the dignity that is derived from gorgeous trappings, but Goya
has not spared them, or us, a tittle of their pitiful stupidity, their
coarse insolence, their mental and moral degeneracy. ‘The heads are
admirably painted, as Gautier admitted, ‘and are full of life, delicacy
and intelligence’; but the French critic’s general verdict upon the
group represented is his best tribute to the genius of the painter;&mdash;‘a
grocer’s family who have won the big lottery prize.’</p>

<p>The more closely one studies these royal portraits the more one becomes
convinced of their truth. To-day they remain as real to us as the
sympathetic, Velazquezesque likenesses of the painter Bayeu in the
Prado, or of Dr. Peral in the National Gallery. It is almost impossible
for any one to be in a position to award the palm for supreme excellence
among Goya’s portraits, for besides being so numerous, they are widely
distributed among the aristocratic families of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span> Spain, and many are
practically inaccessible to the student. There are fewer than two dozen
of his portraits in the Prado, only two in the National Gallery, and one
in the Louvre. Few people are familiar with more than a certain number
of his portraits. For this reason there are many different opinions as
to the comparative merit of his pictures, but the individual opinions
all constitute a remarkable tribute to the painter’s genius in catching
the likeness and reflecting the character of his subjects.</p>

<p>Of the portrait of Villanueva, Señor Caveda writes that ‘it not only
faithfully represents the features of the famous architect and the
expression of him as a whole, but reveals in him the goodness of soul
that animates him, and the noble simplicity of character which is so
skilfully transmitted in all Goya’s impressions.’ Señor Mariano Nonqués,
referring to the portrait of Moratin, now in the possession of Don F.
Silvela, declares that ‘it may rightly be said without any appearance of
exaggeration that this effigy is painted with the mind and with a
spontaneity which is clearly seen, since there is nothing in it that
reveals difficulty in the work, or any preconceived idea of imitating
any other painter in its execution,’ and he adds that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> by reason of the
individuality it discloses, it should be considered one of the best
likenesses painted by Goya. According to the painter Carlos Luis de
Ribera, the genius of ‘La Tirana’ may be seen in the head of the
portrait of the distinguished actress, Rosario Fernandez. ‘In it, as in
all his (Goya’s) works,’ says this authority, ‘there is that air of
truth which so few painters have attained; there is brilliancy and
freshness without pretension or exaggeration, the model is simple and
convenient, and while it makes no show of strength it is not weak. Its
execution springs as much from sentiment as that of all his canvases,
because it was never sought after by Goya, but was the consequence and
result of his spontaneity and intuition.’ Again, of his portrait of José
Luis Munarriz, the eminent critic, Don Francisco Maria Tubina, writes:
‘There is something on the canvas in addition to perfection in the
technique, the beautiful development of the subject and the exact
likeness; the immaterial part must be recognised and appreciated&mdash;the
inner vigour Goya gives the character, which illumines the features with
the glow of the soul. Munarriz is represented to us in the picture as
the fancy imagines him, as we see him in his biography, ingenious and
lively in thought, dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span>tinguished in form, kind and firm in temperament,
prudent in judgment, and with a mind always directed upon things which
elevate and ennoble. Munarriz the literary man,’ he says in conclusion,
‘is the Munarriz of the picture, the one being explained by the other.’
And read, also, what the <i>Boletin de la Sociedad Española de
Excursiones</i> contains concerning the two portraits of Doña Antonia de
Zárate, now in the possession of Señora Vinda de Albacete: ‘But where
Goya shows the most exquisite sensibility and profound psychology is in
these two portraits of one person, in which he incorporates the whole
story of a dreamer swayed in life and death by the highest ideals, a
woman of a race of poets and artists, Antonia de Zárate. Though in the
first portrait he represented her smiling and in perfect health, in the
second he knew her existence was undermined by a treacherous disease
which was to cause her death. Never have we felt more deeply the
impression of pathos than before this presentment of a soul rather than
a person, before this face enveloped in transparent veils, with life
showing in the eyes, and in that life a melancholy realisation of
approaching death.’</p>

<p>Goya’s portraits, as we have said, are so numerous that it is only
possible to deal here with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> brief selection of them. In his large and
varied gallery he displays so much versatility that it appears
impossible that they could all have been conceived by the same mind and
painted by the same hand. His treatment is alternately rough to the
verge of violence and as smooth as the work of a miniaturist; his tones
are crude and heavy or luminous and glowing, as the sitter appeals to
his mind; he makes his queen a confessed harlot and his little grandson
the incarnation of dainty boyhood. The portrait of his wife, now in the
Prado, is a work of the highest excellence, so are the beautiful
representations of the Duchess of Alba, the vivid impression of Asensi,
the delicious portrait of the Marquesa de Pontejos, the
Gainsboroughesque study of the Conde de Florida Blanca, the equestrian
painting of General Palafox, the dashing, almost contemptuously vivid
likeness of Godoy, the striking portrait of Guillemardet so
enthusiastically eulogised by M. León Legrange (<i>Gazette des
Beaux-Arts</i>), and those of the Duke of Osuna, of Felix Colón,
Jove-Llanos and Ventura Rodriguez, of Martincho and Romero, the
bull-fighters, of Pignatelly, General Urrutia, of the royal children,
and of himself, painted when still young&mdash;each portrait bears the stamp
of Goya’s genius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> each expresses an individuality in his individual
style, each is finished because its effect is true.</p>

<p>Goya’s portrait of the Duke of San Carlos, the most loyal friend of the
son of Maria Luisa, has won the admiration of many painters and critics.
The head is beautifully painted, the posing is natural and graceful, the
figure lives and breathes. For this ‘miracle of art,’ as Viñaza styles
it, Goya used only a few colours, which he spread over the canvas with
an energetic and grandiose brush, each stroke being the expression of an
æsthetic thought and the perfection of the technique of painting. The
portrait, ‘which legitimises Goya’s descent from Velazquez,’ is said to
be like the work of Rembrandt in its clare-obscure, of Watteau in its
correctness, and of Titian in its delicacy and freshness. But there is
no end to the expressions of admiration which Goya has inspired. Eduardo
Rosales went to Zaragoza annually to visit Goya’s portrait of the Duke
of San Carlos, and on one occasion, when he had been lifted by a friend
that he might study the face of the portrait, he is reported to have
exclaimed, ‘My friend, such painting will never be seen again.’</p>

<p>In 1798 Goya was intrusted with the decoration of the newly built church
of San Antonio<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span> de la Florida, which had sprung into existence in 1720
as a primitive hermitage, had been destroyed when the El Pardo road was
made in 1768, was re-erected two years later, and in 1792 was replaced
by the present elegant edifice, which was built at the expense of the
royal patrimony, after the plans of the celebrated architect, Ventura
Rodriguez. The outside of the building is of good architectural style,
the interior is small and elegant, and well suited to the rank and
fashion which frequented it. The Church was opened for worship on July
1, 1799, and we read that ‘Madrid went wild with excitement at the glory
of Goya’s achievement.’</p>

<p>Don Juan de Dios de la Rada y Delgado, who supplied the text for the
volume of aquafortis engravings of these frescoes which D. José Moria
Galvan y Candela executed in 1897, tells us that they were wholly in
accord with the conditions of the time. But the sentiment of Mr.
Rothenstein is nearer to the truth when, in speaking of these frescoes,
he says that he can remember nothing which gave him so clear an idea of
Goya’s cynicism. ‘Imagine,’ he writes, ‘a coquettish little church with
a white and gold interior, more like a boudoir than a shrine, but
furnished with altar, and seats, and confessionals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span> One’s nostrils
expect an odour of <i>frangipane</i> rather than incense, and it must be
admitted that Goya’s frescoes do not strike a discordant note in this
indecorously holy place.’</p>

<p>The subject of the main composition covers the cupola, and contains
upwards of a hundred figures considerably over life-size. The picture
illustrates the miracle ascribed to St. Anthony of Padua, who restored
to life the corpse of a murdered man in order that he might reveal the
name of his assassin and rescue an innocent man who was about to be
executed as the perpetrator of the crime. The scene is enclosed by a
painted railing which surrounds the entire composition. We see the saint
standing on an eminence against a luminous background. His life-giving
words have just restored the corpse to consciousness. The man leans
forward, supported in the arms of a companion, with his hands clasped in
an attitude of profound veneration, his expressive face looking fixedly
upon the saint with a gaze of surprise and gratitude. The central
figures are surrounded by a motley crowd of men, women, and children,
some of whom express their astonishment by eloquent gestures, while
others appear indifferent to the miracle that is being performed, and
one or two frolicsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span> boys are seen astride the figured railing. On the
spandrils, the intrados, the curvilineal triangles of the arches, and
behind the high altar, are groups of angels and cherubs. The angels are
beautifully clothed and almost wanton in their human loveliness, the
babes are entirely without the illusion of divine origin. It has been
said that in this composition Goya perfectly interpreted the spirit of
the Church de la Florida; certain it is that these angels with ‘the skin
of a camellia, eyes of fire, and the beauty of a harlot,’ which move
with audacious freedom of attitude, ‘not in pure spheres of blessedness,
but in an atmosphere of atoms of gold illuminated by an Asiatic sun, are
the strangest and most beautiful creatures that ever adorned a
consecrated house.’</p>

<p>‘The frescoes of la Florida,’ comments C. Gasquoine Hartley, ‘are yet
another witness of the truthful humour of Goya’s insight, but not one of
his countrymen realised the irreverent irony of his work.’ ‘The figures
are as full of piquant intention,’ declared Richard Muther, ‘as can be
found in the most erotic paintings of Fragonard.... It is an artistic
<i>can-can</i>; it is Casanova transferred to colour. All that the Church
painting of the past had created is despised, forsaken;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span> and this satire
upon the Church and all its works was written in the land of Zurbarán,
of Murillo.’ The Conde de la Viñaza alludes to Goya as an artist who
painted pictures with religious subjects, but not religious pictures. ‘I
do not know,’ he says, ‘a more profane master than this Velazquez,
Rembrandt, Vicelli and Veronese rolled into one.’ And he instances his
monumental painting at la Florida to illustrate his contention: ‘An
admirable energy, the most splendid scale of tones. What relief! What a
magic of colour! What a beautiful lesson the light of nature receives
there! On the other hand, what lack of religious feeling and
spirituality in those frescoes!’ And having denounced in the angels the
silkiness of their skins, the brilliance of their eyes, and the
wantonness of their beauty, he adds, ‘the miracles of the exemplary man
of Padua are familiarly treated as a spectacle of wandering rope-dancers
might be!’</p>

<p>It has been said that the King was incensed against the artist for
introducing renowned ladies of his court in the faces of the winged
archangels, and it is generally believed that the most aristocratic
persons of the capital are represented in the frescoes, but if Charles
<small>IV.</small> resented his choice of models, he had a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span> amiable way of
expressing his displeasure. Goya himself, writing to Zapater, admitted
that ‘the King and Queen are mad on your friend Goya,’ but the madness
took the form of a royal order, dated October 31, 1799, which reads:
‘H.M. wishing to reward your distinguished merit and to give in person a
testimony that may serve as a stimulus to all professors, of how much he
appreciates your talent and knowledge of the noble art of painting, has
been pleased to appoint you his chief painter of the Chamber, at a
yearly salary of 50,000 reals, which you will receive from this date
free of rights, and also 500 ducats a year for a carriage: and it is
also his pleasure that you occupy the house now inhabited by Don Mariano
Maëlla should he die first,’ etc.</p>

<p>Certainly the frescoes in his own day were extolled as the most
important work ever done by Goya’s marvellous brush; he closed the
eighteenth century with creations that won for him his greatest
contemporary fame and raised him to the summit of his art. If nothing
could be further removed from religious inspiration, nothing human could
reveal more enchanting beauty, more exquisite grace. These frescoes were
praised as ‘an inimitable symphony of light and colour.’ It is not in
our province either to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> accept or to refute the claim that ‘they raise
the most common things of Goya’s time to the high spheres of Spanish
mystic realism.’ Goya’s contemporaries did not realise that the
paintings outraged the canons of propriety and probability, and in later
times Señor Rada finds that the painter, in this work, rises always to
the regions of mystery, where only genius can penetrate, and responds to
the peculiar influence of a temple which seems rather to inspire loving
human aspirations, than mystic thoughts of infinite abstraction. ‘Apart
from the fact that Goya was a believer and respectful to all that
pertained to religion,’ urges Señor Rada, ‘in the principal subject of
this painting (the “Cupola”) he is as manifestly mystic and delicate as
any painter of the spiritual school. In the central group the risen man
partakes of both realism and religious unction. The expression could not
be better, nor could the attitude of the saint be more dignified. Apart
from this in the other groups, he copied what he was wont to observe in
popular gatherings, as he saw it, as it was, as it always will be.’</p>

<p>Goya’s Spanish apologists may well be justified in their contention that
his originality forced him to disregard the classic rules and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span> mannerism
of traditional Spanish religious art. They see no impropriety or
extravagance in surrounding the figure of a revered saint with a crowd
of roysterers, prostitutes, cut-purses and Manzanares rascals. And,
after all, the point is scarcely worth arguing. Again, when it is
protested that Goya’s archangels and seraphim were rather beautiful
women than angelic spirits&mdash;well! what better conception could there be
of angels than the perfections of a charming woman? That is Señor Rada’s
retort: ‘The naturalist Goya, surrounded by the seductive beauty of his
time, could not conceive or even presume that the chosen beings who sing
eternal praises in the ethereal regions of celestial glory were any
different. More in accord doubtless, with our pious traditions and with
Christian spiritual belief are the glories of Juan de Juanes and
Murillo; but each artist has his peculiar temperament as well as his
special gamut of colour, and to ask Goya to paint angels like those
great Christian artists would be the same as asking the painters of a
previous epoch to paint pictures of popular scenes like Goya’s.’</p>

<p>The logic of the foregoing is presumably sound, although the conclusion
seems to us to support those who contend that Goya’s temperament<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span>
rendered him an unsuitable person to translate religious episodes into
colour. We remember, as Señors Rada and Pedro de Madrazo assert, that
Goya was ‘a believer’ and ‘respectful in everything pertaining to
religion,’ and we recall also that in their joint will the painter and
his wife describe themselves as ‘firmly believing and confessing the
mystery of the Holy Trinity ... and all other mysteries and sacraments,
believed and confessed by our Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Mother
Church, in whose true faith and belief we have lived.’ But we cannot, at
the same time, forget that Goya’s detestation of the priesthood was
violent and unresting. If he caught the spirit of ecstasy in his picture
of San José de Calasanz receiving the Host at the hands of a priest, he
also painted a representation of Santas Justa and Rufina. This picture
has been described as the most profane and inappropriate work of the
Aragonese genius. It is stated that he selected as his models a pair of
well-known <i>cocottes</i> of Madrid, giving, it is said, the caustic,
uncanonical explanation, ‘I will cause the faithful to worship vice!’
Goya may have called himself an orthodox conformer to the national
church, but his contempt for his ecclesiastical patrons and those who
practised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span> devotions which he mechanically professed, is avowed.</p>

<p>But apart from their religious significance, or their lack of it, these
frescoes of the Church of San Antonio de la Florida reveal Goya at his
best as a daring draughtsman and fine colourist. The energy, the
spontaneity, the light and the relief, the magic of his paint&mdash;all are
revealed in this work, which occupied him only three months. And what
better proof could one desire of the truth of his own contention: ‘In
nature colour exists no more than line&mdash;there is only light and shade.’
Goya knew how to produce abundant life with simply white lead, the black
of smoke, green and vermillion. Richness of colour does not consist in
an infinite variety of tints, but in the harmonious variety of tones and
in the skilful selection of the key in which the picture is painted.
Here Goya surpassed himself in the effect he produced with a palette
that was severe in its simplicity, but the processes employed by the
master to obtain his wonderfully vivid and charming tones were so varied
that they cannot be exactly determined. Of the result, Paul Lafond
writes, it is ‘as true as Velazquez, as energetic and as light as
Rembrandt, as delicate as Titian, as spiritual as Tiepolo, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span>
infinite perspectives like those of Tiepolo and Veronese, and as refined
as Watteau.’</p>

<p>The painting of the frescoes of San Antonio de la Florida won for Goya,
as we have seen, the coveted office of first painter to the Court. It
was at this same time he began to paint less and to take up the needle
as a new force of expression. His first work was the series of designs
known as ‘Los Caprichos’ in which the spectator is transported into some
‘unheard of, impossible, but still real world’&mdash;a world peopled with
dapper <i>majas</i>, handsome hidalgos, hideous old men and hags more
horrible than the witch of Endor, gluttonous priests, spectres and
sorceresses, devils and desperadoes and corpses, all the myriad
diabolical and terrifying shapes and phantasies in which Goya set down
his vision of humanity. The origin, the inspiration and the object of
these etchings are still matters of speculation. It is generally agreed
that the painter executed the first drafts for these plates after his
return from San Lucar. His deafness aggravated by a serious illness,
from which he made a slow and painful recovery, obliged him to give up
the fatiguing work with palette and brush, and it may well be that he,
whose spirit never rested and whose hand was never idle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> fell into a
habit of preserving his impressions on paper in order to distract his
tormented imagination from brooding over his sufferings. It was at a
later date that he transferred these drawings on to the copper plates.
It may be reasonable to assume, as some have done, that the part of
philosopher which he had developed leisurely during his days at Court,
as well as the vein of moralist and castigator of vice, was quickened in
him by satiety and physical pain. The Conde de la Viñaza appears to
believe that Goya suddenly awakened to his power as a caricaturist, and
that, irritated at the moral ugliness of his contemporaries, and at the
vile coterie which surrounded the King and Queen, he began to inveigh
unflinchingly against lasciviousness, covetousness, rapacity, hypocrisy,
and ignorance, against the court parasite and the court harlot, the
miser and the monk, the women who sold their daughters and the monsters
who bought them, against insolent pomp, ecclesiastical rottenness and
venal stupidity. Yet probably the view of Gautier is nearer the truth.
He assumes that the now popular painter was ‘merely producing so many
capricious sketches, when he was in truth drawing the portrait and
writing the history of Spain of former days, under the belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span> that he
was serving the ideas and creed of modern times. His caricatures will
soon be looked upon in the light of historical monuments.’</p>

<p>Extraordinary as these pictures are by reason of their fancy, their
beauty, their saturnine wit, their ‘Gargantuan spirit,’ as well as by
the technical skill and originality they display, they are even more
extraordinary by reason of the favour with which they were at first
received by the people against whom they were directed. At first the
plates were issued separately and were passed from hand to hand among
the etcher’s friends. But in 1799, probably the year in which the series
was completed, a prospectus was issued, advertising the publication of
an edition of seventy-two plates. Goya, for unknown reasons, objected to
this edition, and the issue was never made. In the meantime the satire
of these tumultuous cartoons was discovered by the objects of his
ridicule. Godoy, the old Duchess of Benavente, the Queen’s favourites,
were the first to be identified, then effigies of the Queen herself and
her illustrious lord were recognised upon the plates. The scandal of
these allusions aroused an outburst of indignation, instigated, in great
measure, by the caricatured and crucified clergy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span> The office of the
Inquisition was moved to take action, and Goya’s popularity and
influence were powerless to avert the inevitable catastrophe. Rescue
came from the most unexpected quarter. In 1803 the King caused an
edition of 240 copies of 80 plates, which had already been printed, as
well as the plates themselves, to be acquired by the state, with an
order that he had commanded their publication.</p>

<p>It is difficult to account for this splendid action from such a King as
Charles <small>IV.</small> Was he so impressed by the merits of these etchings that he
was prompted to rescue them from the Inquisition in the interests of
art&mdash;a magnanimity of spirit ‘of which his character gives no promise’?
Probably he was merely insensible to the satire of the pictures. The
‘Caprichos’ were dedicated to the monarch by the artist&mdash;a subtle jest
on the stupidity of the King, who, Muther concludes, ‘was not even in a
position to grasp the meaning of the plates.’ We learn that Charles
remunerated Goya by granting his son a pension of 12,000 reals. A
reproduction of the letter from the painter referring to this
arrangement is as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The technical excellence of the Caprichos makes them comparable with
those of Rembrandt, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> in their meaning and character they may be
likened to the work of Daumier. There are the peculiar qualities of
Goya’s etching, which recall the truth and naturalness of Fernando Boll,
the movement and life of Lievens and Konninck, and the expression and
charm of Von Vliet? These artists, whose best individual qualities are
all combined in Goya, were pupils of Rembrandt. ‘Only Hokusai,’ writes
Mr. Rothenstein, ‘was capable of such monstrous gaiety, such stinging
satire, and he alone could have lent probability to such monstrous
phantasy; Hogarth was too sermonising, Rowlandson too rollicking; a
certain diabolical side of his nature, which Goya allowed to be seen
both in the “Caprichos” and “The Disasters,” has probably prevented his
etchings gaining a footing in England.’ Certain it is that Goya’s prints
are rarely to be met with in this country&mdash;a fact that caused the writer
of this book to spare no effort in order to include in the
illustrations, reproductions of every etching and lithograph, as well as
of every portrait or picture of Goya’s, of which he could secure an
impression.</p>

<p>It is one thing to admire, even to understand, the technique of the
‘Caprichos,’ but to understand the precise significance of many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span>
plates is almost impossible. Perhaps the titles printed by Goya beneath
the plates are the best guide to their meaning. The only reward to be
derived from reading ingenious meanings into the prints is the personal
interest one finds in the exercise. The series may be divided into three
classes; the first are humorous satires of the foolishness and
rottenness of the life of the period; the second are scathing assaults
upon the ignorance and greed of the priesthood and the corruptness of
the civic institutions; and the last are visions of witches and demons,
which may be classed as pure phantasies. There is a depth of meaning in
every plate, for Goya reproduces for us in them not only what he has
seen, but what he has felt. The first plate illustrates a marriage of
convenience, and we are shown the girl-bride being presented to her
hideous suitor by her more hideous mother. Over and over again we are
presented with this type of the ‘complaisant mother,’ which has been
described by Théophile Gautier in illuminating prose. ‘It is impossible’
he writes, ‘to fancy anything more grotesquely horrible, more viciously
deformed. Each of these frightful old shrews unites in her own person
the ugliness of the seven capital sins; compared to them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> Prince of
Darkness himself is pretty. Just fancy whole ditches and counterscarps
of wrinkles; eyes like live coals that have been extinguished in blood;
noses like the neck of an alembic covered with warts and other
excrescences; nostrils like those of an hippopotamus rendered formidable
by stiff bristles; whiskers like a tiger’s; a mouth like the slit in the
top of a money-box, contracted by a horrible and convulsive grin; a
something between the spider and the multiped which makes you feel the
same kind of disgust as if you had placed your foot upon the belly of a
toad.’ The description is horrible even as Goya’s engravings are
horrible, and as excellently true as the work by which it was inspired.</p>

<p>It is not possible in the space at our command to review these
‘Caprichos’ in detail, and fortunately it is not necessary. The reader
can examine the plates for himself and study their details. He will
remark the skill with which the engraver endows ‘The Garroted Man’ with
its sombre, gruesome tone; the sense of the unavailing, despairing
effort with which the living skeleton in ‘And yet they do not go’ (Plate
369) supports the slab of stone which must inevitably fall and crush the
crouching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> scarcely human wretches who anticipate their fate with
expressions of such lurid horror. One can feel the violence of the wind
that buffets the women in ‘A Bad Night’; we enter into the terror of the
woman who is employed in her hideous task in ‘Tooth Hunting.’ Here
indeed, ‘horror confronts us; corruptness is imagined with an
unapproachable depth of grotesqueness.’ In all the realm of art there is
nothing to compare with the horror and grotesquerie of these Caprices.</p>

<p>Goya’s next work was the thirty-three plates of ‘The Tauromachia.’ This
series of engravings was so brilliant in execution and appealed so
strongly in their theme and treatment to the Spanish national affection
for the bull-ring, that doubtless they would have brought the etcher
even greater contemporary fame than the larger series, but for some
unexplained reason, they were not publicly issued until after his death
and the death of his only surviving legitimate son. In the ‘Tauromachia’
Goya made less use of aquatint and aquafortis, and, as in his later
etchings, relied more and more upon the needle to produce his effects.
These scenes of the bull-ring represent the different phases of the
combat and the surpassing feats of its most famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> exponents. The
‘Caprices’ may appeal more strongly in some respects, but the drawing in
the plates of the ‘Tauromachia’ is extremely light and facile, and the
illusion of vigorous movement is seen in them all.</p>

<p>In 1803 Goya was fifty-seven years old. The corruption in high places,
against which he had hurled his darts, was fast driving Spain into the
grasp of the world-power which was menacing all Europe. Napoleon’s
ambitious designs embraced the mastership of the Peninsula, and he was
already maturing his plans to that end. In 1803 the English and French
were again at war. Napoleon demanded, under the treaty of St. Ildefonso,
that Spain should declare war against England. Godoy strove fiercely to
resist the will of the tyrant. Napoleon ordered the dismissal of Godoy.
Spain purchased her neutrality in hard cash, and Godoy was retained. In
1804 Napoleon was proclaimed Emperor, and the neutrality of the
Spaniards was reduced to such a farce beneath the grinding importunities
of the imperial ally that Pitt declared war against Spain in December of
that year. The battle of Trafalgar was fought on October 21, 1805, but
before the end of the year Napoleon had entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> Vienna and won the
battle of Austerlitz. Before the awful menace of his growing power,
Godoy sued for the favour of the conqueror in gold drawn from the
Spanish funds. The Emperor accepted the money without relaxing his
animus against the despised favourite, who was forced to approach
England with proposals for an anti-French coalition. His overtures were
ignored. The Queen and the King heaped new honours upon the Prince of
the Peace, but his end and that of his august patrons was near.
Ferdinand’s party was working the country into a ferment of hatred
against Godoy, and Napoleon’s inflexible aversion sealed his doom. In
1807 Ferdinand truckled to the ‘Scourge of Europe’ by asking for a lady
of Napoleon’s family for a wife, while Godoy urged upon Napoleon the
occupation of Portugal as a preliminary to the introduction of French
troops into Spain. In October 1807 Portugal proving refractory, Junot
and a strong force encamped on Spanish soil and were made welcome by the
Prince of the Asturias and the Prince of the Peace, both of whom
regarded the invasion of the French as a friendly move, in support of
their respective interests.</p>

<p>In the same month the Court was stricken by the exposure of the plot and
counterplot planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> by the rascally favourite and the intriguing Crown
Prince. Godoy was charged by Ferdinand with the intention of killing the
King and his family and seizing the throne; Ferdinand was surprised in a
plot which embraced the imprisonment if not the death of his father. The
Prince of the Asturias was placed under arrest, and the King applied to
Napoleon for his advice. Junot marched into Portugal; French troops
poured into Spain; the Portuguese Regent, at the advice of Lord
Strangford, transferred his court to Brazil. On March 17, 1808, the
troops, in favour of Ferdinand, prevented Godoy from leaving Aranguez,
and two days later threw him, bruised and bleeding, at the feet of the
Prince of the Asturias, who gave his father to understand that, by
virtue of the presence in the capital of his friends the French, he was
absolute master of the situation. Charles <small>IV.</small> signed a decree which made
Ferdinand <small>VII.</small> sovereign of Spain. A few days later he put his name to a
private withdrawal of his abdication; and this document was forwarded to
Napoleon, with a letter offering to conform to whatever the Emperor
might order with regard to him, his queen, and the Prince of the Peace.
Napoleon came south towards Spain. Ferdinand, who hastened north to meet
him, entered Bayonne to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> find himself a prisoner. Charles <small>IV.</small>, with
Maria Luisa and Godoy, followed to Bayonne, and Ferdinand was compelled
to restore the crown to his father, who transferred it to Napoleon. The
cash consideration the King was to receive for his sovereignty was never
paid.</p>

<p>While these base traffickings were occupying the King and his family,
the gallant loyalists of Madrid had risen against the French and
suffered massacre on the terrible Dos de Mayo. Once again the country
was in arms; the Spaniards fought&mdash;to instance only the sieges of
Zaragoza and Valencia&mdash;with superb valour, but the Junta continued its
servile negotiations with Napoleon, and Joseph Buonaparte, King of
Naples, was summoned by his brother to rule over Spain. On July 9, 1808,
Joseph <small>I.</small> set foot in his new kingdom. On the 17th the French were
defeated in the battle of Baileu, and the victorious Spanish troops
advanced over the Sierra Morena to Madrid. The new king fled the
capital. Napoleon in person took command of the army which was to
reconquer Spain, and advanced into the heart of Castile. The left
division of the Spanish army was defeated on November 11, the right was
driven into the mountains of Aragon, the centre was completely crushed
at Tudela on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> November 26. A fortnight later the Emperor entered Madrid,
and Joseph <small>I.</small> was restored to the throne of Spain.</p>

<p>Goya’s position was rendered acutely difficult by these drastic changes.
The first painter of the exiled King, the favourite of his dispersed
courtiers, what could he do in the court of the hated Joseph Buonaparte?
It may be surmised that ‘the good old Goya,’ as Gautier familiarly
styles him, hated the new order of things, but he was no visionary
patriot burning with the fire of useless sacrifice. His love of country
was not love of Charles <small>IV.</small> or his son; he loved Spain not less because
Maria Luisa and Godoy were out of it. And as he asked himself what
action he should take, he saw the Prince of the Asturias submit himself
to the new ruler, and with him Jove-Llanos, Mazarrado and Urquijo, the
Dukes of Fernan Nuñez and del Parque, the Count of Santa Colonna, the
Cardinal of Bourbon&mdash;to mention a few only among the nobles. Goya’s
comrades also, the Court painters, Mariano Maëlla, Francisco Ramos, and
Pablo Racio, acknowledged the ‘intrusive king’! Goya hesitated no
longer. He took the oath of allegiance to Joseph <small>I.</small> He was made a knight
of the Legion of Honour. He painted the usurper’s portrait, and some
time<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span> later accepted, with Napoli and Maëlla, the commission to select
from the treasures of the royal gallery fifty of the most beautiful
pictures which were to be sent to the Louvre.</p>

<p>But though the old order had changed and Goya had changed with it, his
spirit was full of bitterness. He had witnessed the butchery and
slaughter of the French soldiers; he hated the sound of the clanking of
the spurs of Murat’s hussars on the pavements of Madrid.</p>

<p>Already he had painted two pictures, the ‘Dos de Mayo’ and ‘Un Episodio
de la Invasión Francesca.’ One has only to study these two pictures of
realised terror, in the Prado, to understand the painter’s hatred of the
French and the brooding melancholy which the events of the rising in
Madrid had fastened upon his soul and darkened his life. De Amicis, the
Italian author, writes, with a fine appreciation of the stirring realism
of these works: ‘Nothing more tremendous can be imagined: one can give
no more execrable form to power, nor frightful aspect to desperation,
nor a more ferocious expression to the fury of a fray. In the first one
there is a dark sky, the light of a lantern, a pool of blood, a pile of
bodies, a crowd of men condemned to death, and a line of French
soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span> in the act of firing; in the other are horses with their veins
cut, and horsemen dragged from their saddles, stabbed, trodden upon, and
lacerated. What faces! What attitudes! One seems to hear the cries and
see the blood running: the veritable scene could not cause more horror.
Goya must have painted these pictures with his eyes glaring, foam at his
mouth, and with the fury of a demoniac; it is the last point which
painting can reach before being translated into action; having passed
that point one throws away the brush and seizes the dagger; one must
commit murder in order to do anything more terrible than those pictures;
after those colours, comes blood.’</p>

<p>Goya retired to the seclusion of his house outside the gates of the
capital, only opening his doors to a few old friends, among whom were
Cean Bermudez the art critic, Carnicero the illustrator of <i>Don
Quixote</i>, Castillo the painter, and Selma the engraver. The old painter
had become completely deaf, and, in these dark days of change and
violence, the bitterness of his spirit found further expression in the
‘Desastres de la Guerra’&mdash;‘the cry of a just soul against the iniquity
of warfare.’ With passionate vigour he depicted the horrors of the
French invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> and lashed with his satire the barbarities of the
conquerors. The new series was begun in the year 1810. They reproduce
all the sad and abominable events which had culminated in the accession
of Joseph Bonaparte. Callot, in his scenes of the barbarities of the
Thirty Years’ War, did not attain the fire, the power, or the purpose of
these plates. All the horrors of warfare and its heroism and the
stupidity of war are depicted here with searching truth. The technique
of the plates is unsurpassed. We see starving men made bestial with
terror, dead bodies stripped and mutilated, women outraged, and children
butchered before the eyes of their frenzied mothers. And again we are
shown the superb heroism of the women who, armed only with hatchets and
stones, withstood the onslaught of the dragoons; we are made to realise
the intrepid loyalty of those men and women who fought side by side on
the terrible Dos de Mayo; we witness the masculine daring of the women
who took the match from the hands of the dead artillerymen and continued
to work the guns. Every phase of warfare, its famine and desolation, its
hunger and disease, its heroism and its savagery, are depicted in this
impeachment of Militarism. The utter uselessness of war is em<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span>phasised
in the haunting echo which runs through all the plates&mdash;‘To what end?’
The wasteful sacrifice of human lives is forced upon Goya’s audience by
an engraving in this series inscribed with the word ‘Nada’
(Nothingness). Gautier in his rare volume, <i>Travels in Spain</i> (so rare
that I need make no apology for again quoting from it), writes of this
plate: ‘Among these drawings which admit of an easy explanation, there
is one fearfully terrible and mysterious, the meaning of which, that we
can dimly understand, fills you with horror and affright. It is a
corpse, half-buried in the earth; it is supporting itself on its elbow,
and, without looking at what it is writing, traces with its bony hand,
on a paper placed near it, one word&mdash;“Nothingness”&mdash;which is alone worth
the most terrible things Dante ever penned. Around its head, on which
there is just enough flesh left to render it more frightful than a mere
skull, flit, scarcely visible in the darkness of the night, a number of
monstrous spectres, lighted up here and there by flashes of vivid
lightning. A fatidical hand holds a pair of scales, which are in the act
of turning upside down. Can you conceive anything more sinister or more
heartrending?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span>’</p>

<p>The ‘Disasters’ were not published in a series until 1863, when the
Academy of San Fernando acquired eighty plates and issued the engravings
with a brief introductory note. In this introduction the writer says:
‘The collection which Goya designated by the name of <i>Ravages</i> or
<i>Disasters of War</i>, is indisputably one of the most notable of the kind
that he produced. In it is all the strength of his lively imagination,
exalted and excited by a deep patriotic feeling in those terrible
moments when an unjust foreign invasion essayed to humiliate the pride
and hauteur which are a characteristic of the Spaniard. What matter for
surprise then that a Spaniard, an Aragonese, a man with the stern
independent character of Goya, should allow himself to be carried away
very often by exaggeration and caricature?... On the other hand, this
work breathes novelty in the subjects, originality in the types, fire in
the composition, boldness and firmness in the colouring, decision and
even fineness in the design.... In order that nothing shall be lacking
in this collection, there is given on each plate the inscriptions which
afford another proof of the artist’s genius. These inscriptions,
concise, incisive, and piquant, add character, if that be possible, to
what the pencil had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> accomplished; the brief phrases, at times a
single word, reveal by their sense of rapidity the fugitive idea which
his mind had conceived in a moment, and which, in little more than
another moment, his hand had represented.’</p>

<p>A very interesting series of drawings and etchings are preserved in the
Print Room of the British Museum. Of these ten are reproduced in this
book for the first time. The Goya collection in the Museum consists of
eight original drawings, a holograph letter of Goya and no fewer than
two hundred and eighty-one separate works, comprising etchings and
lithographs of the Proverbs, Caprices, Tauromachia, and Disasters of
War, and the subjects after Velazquez. They are all in a splendid state
of preservation. Of the selection made for the present volume (Nos.
601-12), the portrait of the Duke of Wellington (601) and ‘A Lost Soul’
(605), have been reproduced by Mr. Rothenstein. The sketch of the Duke,
whom Goya in the letter referred to, writes ‘Weelingthon,’ served the
painter in executing the large portrait. It was made on the day
following the battle of Salamanca (1812), when Marmont was defeated on
the field of Arapiles. The ‘Lady and Gentleman on Horseback’ (No. 602)
have not been identified, although the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> is evidently a portrait.
The head of Fray Juan Fernanez (No. 603), drawn at the moment of his
last breath, is a very powerful sketch. In No. 609 the artist depicts
misery in a few masterly touches, and in Nos. 607, 608, and 609 he
illustrates proverbs with his peculiar freakish fancy. The study of
bulls (610) is another spirited sketch. The remaining plates represent
scenes of the bull-ring.</p>

<p>Goya still brooded over the misfortunes which the Royal family and their
hated favourite between them had brought about by folly, ignorance, and
baseness; and over the sufferers, the common people, who still
sacrificed their lives to reinstate their corrupt but accustomed
oppressors. But the end was near. The leading patriots, assembled at
Cadiz, were engaged in framing a constitution which was to mark the
commencement of modern Spain. Meanwhile Wellington was driving the
French troops before him&mdash;Olivenza, Fuentes de Oñoro, Almeida, Albuera,
Ciudad Rodrigo, and Badajoz indicate the line of their retreat. The
country was being drained and devastated to provide money for continuing
the war. Joseph was providing bull-fights and shows to divert the mind
of the Madrileños from the national misery. Napoleon was overwhelming
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span> brother with blame for a state of affairs which was neither of his
making nor controlling. Madrid, cut off from supplies, was wasted by an
appalling visitation of famine which lasted from September 1811 to
August 1812, when Wellington’s liberating army reached the capital to
find that Joseph had already beaten a retreat. The Napoleonic rule was
over. Joseph returned to Madrid, but it was only to pack up his
belongings, to loot churches and palaces and retire with the plunder to
France. On June 21, 1813, Wellington met the retiring intruders at
Vittoria, and Joseph, with a greatly diminished burden of treasure,
barely escaped with his life. Thereafter Napoleon abandoned his schemes
of Spanish conquest; Ferdinand, the prisoner of Valençay,&mdash;who had
danced in captivity while his country bled, who still sought a marital
alliance with the house of Buonaparte, who had slobbered his
felicitations on the birth of the King of Rome and congratulated the
Emperor upon his victory over the Spaniards&mdash;Ferdinand was now free to
receive the welcome which his loyal countrymen were eager to give him.</p>

<p>Ferdinand ‘the desired,’ after swearing to respect the new constitution,
re-entered Spain in March 1814 amidst an incredible outburst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> popular
enthusiasm. Two days before he reached Madrid every member of the Cortes
and every known friend of the constitution was thrown into prison. By
the publication of the decree of Valencia he proclaimed himself an
autocrat, by his acts he proved himself a tyrant. He re-established the
Inquisition, he decreed the ancient taxes; the country, desolated by war
waged on his behalf, was thrown into lamentable disorder by the greed of
the coarse and ignorant bloodsuckers whom the King gathered around him.
Charles <small>IV.</small> was a paternal sovereign, and Joseph <small>I.</small> was an enlightened
ruler beside Ferdinand <small>VII.</small> Neither Liberals nor Conservatives were
safe. He imprisoned the men who had striven and bled to effect his
return; he persecuted without mercy those who had sworn allegiance to
Joseph. Goya was one of the first and fiercest, according to Lafond, to
acclaim the return of the King. For a time he sought refuge from his
sovereign in the house of his friend José Duaso y Latre, who kept him in
hiding for three months. At the expiration of that time he found that
Ferdinand was inclined to condone his defection. It is reported that he
pardoned him with the words, ‘In our absence you have deserved exile,
nay worse, you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> merited death; but you are a great artist, and we
will forget everything.’</p>

<p>So ‘the good old Goya’ was reinstated as Court painter, and he executed
several portraits of the new sovereign. It is evident from these
likenesses that the painter recognised the weakness and worthlessness of
Ferdinand. He viewed his sitter in the same clear, critical,
uncompromising spirit with which he had gazed on his royal parents; he
painted the weak, shifty, uncultured despot as he was. The equestrian
portrait of Ferdinand <small>VII.</small> is commonplace. His portrait of the monarch
in his gorgeous mantle is almost a caricature of royalty, and in his
other likenesses he betrays his antipathy to the restored Bourbon. That
Goya’s palette still emitted ‘rays of prodigious art’ when he painted
people who were congenial to him, is shown by many of the portraits of
this period; for instance, by that of the Marquis de San Adrián, of Don
Ignacio Garcini and his wife, of Don Evaristo Pérez de Castro, and by
the beautiful study of Goya’s little niece, La Felicianæ, which is one
of the tenderest and most delicate of all his portraits.</p>

<p>Another royal commission entrusted to Goya was to paint episodes of the
war, especially of the siege of Zaragoza. Accompanied by his pupil<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span> Luis
Gil Ranz, he set out to obtain studies. Owing to the exaltation of the
populace the journey is said to have abounded in incidents and perils.
The language of signs which Ranz employed in conversing with his deaf
master caused them to be mistaken for spies. They were forced to seek
sanctuary at Renales, the pupil’s native town, where they waited until a
favourable opportunity offered for their return to Madrid.</p>

<p>The melancholy which had settled upon Goya after the accession of the
intrusive King increased with advancing age. In the seclusion of his
house (the house in which he had entertained the noblest of the Court
circle&mdash;the Deaf Man’s House, as it came to be called by the Madrileños)
he beguiled the time by painting the walls with fantastic and gruesome
visions which gave it an awesome and startling appearance. But the
brilliant fancy had been obscured by the national vicissitudes he had
witnessed and the haunting memories of the war obsessed his imagination.
These paintings, which are now preserved in the Prado, produce a painful
impression; they would seem to be the creations of a fevered brain.</p>

<p>In 1817 Goya visited Seville to paint the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span> picture of Santas Justa and
Rufina for the Cathedral, to which reference has been made. On his
return he designed a new series of Caprices, and executed many portraits
and miniatures on ivory. It was at this time, too, that he made his
first essay in lithography. The earliest of these lithographs is a fine
brush drawing of an old woman spinning. It is signed and dated February
1819. Among the drawings upon stone that were executed about this
period, the two most important are ‘Los Chiens,’ a bull attacked by
dogs, and the splendid diabolical scene of a man being dragged along by
demons. This last, which is in the Print Room of the British Museum, has
special interest, as it is the first known wash drawing made upon the
stone. M. Lefort mentions six other lithographs which were executed at
Madrid before the journey to France: a duel between two people, a young
woman reading to two children, a monk, a girl sitting on the knee of an
old woman with other women in the background, a drunkard and a woman,
and a peasant assaulting a girl.</p>

<p>The date of the execution of ‘Los Proverbios,’ the fourth series of
Goya’s etchings,&mdash;‘the last thunderbolt of his genius,’&mdash;is uncertain.
Probably they belong to those years when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> under the weight of distress
of spirits in his lonely home on the Manzanares, he sketched the world
within him as it appeared to his gloomy imagination. The plates are
without explanatory titles, and their meaning is obscure. Mr.
Rothenstein finds in the larger size and broader execution of the plates
themselves the reason for his belief that these are the last etchings by
Goya’s hand before his failing eyesight forced him to lay aside the
needle. The plates were first printed in 1830. This edition was edited
with little care, and in 1864 a second edition was undertaken by the
Academy of San Fernando. There were eighteen of these plates, but three
more, reproduced much later in <i>L’Art</i>, may be placed among them.</p>

<p>There remain several important etchings; among them the three fine and
impressive plates of ‘The Prisoners’ come first in importance. In these,
as Mr. Rothenstein has said, ‘Goya’s powers as an etcher and his
sympathy for suffering are demonstrated in a striking and singularly
direct manner.’ Beneath the prints he has written in three sentences,
his last protest against injustice: ‘The safe guarding of a prisoner
does not necessitate torture’; ‘If he is guilty, why not kill him at
once?’ ‘So much<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span> barbarity in the treatment equals the crime committed.’
The first proofs of these prints Goya gave to his friend, Cean Bermudez.
The plates known as <i>Obras Sueltas</i> were not, as far as we know, printed
in Goya’s lifetime. They show a man swinging a woman on a swing, with a
cat watching her from the bough of a tree; a bull-fighter with a bull
lying down behind him; and two representations of <i>majas</i>. They were
first etched at Bordeaux, and from the somewhat crude style of the work,
probably were the last prints executed by Goya.</p>

<p>Among several unconnected prints we may mention the superb engraving of
‘The Colossus,’ which seems like an etching at first glance and has
defied the attempts of experts to explain the highly complicated process
of its execution. As an illustration of Goya’s resources for producing a
marvellous impression, this piece constitutes a veritable <i>tour de
force</i>. The giant is placed in a vast landscape, and beside his uncouth
might and Herculean muscles, cities and villages seem diminutive and
insignificant atoms of the soil on which he rests. He is frightened into
wakefulness by the morning sun which touches his mighty head and
shoulders; they seem as if the summit of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span> mountain, while his feet are
yet in the shadow of night. A mysterious, pale, fantastic effect of
moonlight throws a peculiar atmosphere about the figure. As we have
already remarked, the process by which the effect is obtained remains
inexplicable. According to a statement made by Goya’s grandson, the
engraver employed a very soft metal plate from which only three
impressions could be taken. One of these impressions is in the National
Library of Madrid. A brilliant and rare old engraving of ‘A Blind Guitar
Player,’ a large but inferior plate of a popular scene, and three
etchings of religious subjects, complete the list of Goya’s
miscellaneous etchings.</p>

<p>In June 1824, at the age of seventy-six, Goya set out for France. Before
starting he painted his ‘San José de Calasanz receiving the
Sacrament’&mdash;perhaps his finest religious composition. The work was
scarcely dry when he sought and obtained the King’s permission to take
the mineral waters at Plombières in France. The remainder of his life’s
story is soon told. In Paris he made the personal acquaintance of
Vernet, and found delight in the works of Gros, of Géricault, and of
Delacroix. The last master did honour to Goya by copying every plate of
the ‘Caprichos.’ But the full life of Paris was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span> overwhelming for
the old painter, and having obtained in January 1825 a six months’
extension of leave from the King, he settled down in Bordeaux with his
devoted friends, Mme. Weiss and her daughter. In the little Spanish
colony on the pleasant banks of the Garonne, he had for companions
Joseph de Carnerero, the marine painter, Antonio de Brugada, the members
of the family of Goicoechea, and Pio de Molina, and Moratin, whose
portraits he painted. But these pictures do not represent his full
powers; the colours are heavy and sometimes crude; he worked with double
magnifying glasses and a stout lens. But in his engraving, and
especially in his series of lithographs, ‘Les Taureaux de Bordeaux,’
which Mr. Rothenstein describes as ‘the most remarkable compositions of
his life, certainly the greatest and most significant lithographs in the
history of the art,’ his old powers shine forth again in undimmed
brilliance.</p>

<p>In 1826 the feeling of home-sickness drew him back to Madrid. At Court
he was received with every mark of respect. The King granted him a
superannuation salary of 50,000 reals and permission to return to
France, ‘in order that he may again take the baths which have done him
so much good.’ His Majesty requested him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span> sit to Vicente López y
Portaña, in order that he might possess a picture of ‘the greatest
painter Spain has seen since Velazquez.’ López painted ‘the good old
Goya’ life-size, seated full-face, palette in the left hand, brush in
the right, and wearing an unbuttoned frockcoat. The portrait was
executed in a few hours, for at the second sitting Goya carried away the
portrait, assuring the painter that he would only spoil the likeness if
he persevered any further with ‘his niggling brush.’ It is said that he
took palette and brush and essayed a portrait of López, but his hand,
cold and trembling, refused to respond to the call made upon it, and the
attempt was a failure.</p>

<p>The royal pension and permission to return to France is dated July 17,
1826. Accompanied by his grandson, Mariano, he betook himself again to
Bordeaux. His declining years were cheered by the affectionate
attentions of his young compatriot, Antonio de Brugada, who attended him
in his infrequent strolls, suffered patiently his querulous moods, and
even played to him on the piano the national airs which the old man
could not hear. In one last flash of his genius Goya painted an
admirable portrait of Juan Maguiro. It was his last work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> beneath
the signature he inscribed his age&mdash;eighty-one years.</p>

<p>In March 1828 a premonition that his end was near filled Goya with a
strong desire to see his son once more before he died. When he heard
that his wish was to be realised he wrote to his son: ‘<span class="smcap">Dear Xavier</span>,&mdash;I
can only tell you that this great pleasure has somewhat indisposed me
and I am in bed. God grant that I can see you when you come, and then I
shall be quite satisfied. Good-bye.&mdash;Your father, <span class="smcap">Francisco</span>.’ Xavier
reached Bordeaux on March 13. Three days later Goya had a paralytic
seizure, and surrounded by his family and his intimate friends, ‘the
greatest painter that Spain has seen since Velazquez,’ breathed his
last.</p>

<p>On the following day the remains of Goya were buried in the Goicoechea
family vault in the Grand Chartreux Cemetery of Bordeaux, and the
following inscription was engraved on the stone:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Goya’s remains were removed to Spain at the end of the nineteenth
century. On the afternoon of May 11, 1900, the body was placed in the
San Isidro Cemetery, Madrid, by the side of his old friends Menéndez
Valdés and Leandro Moratin. Already in 1888 the Cortes had voted a sum
of money for the creation of a suitable monument, and a magnificent
cenotaph now marks the resting-place of the last great Spanish painter.</p>

<h3>VARIOUS SUBJECTS</h3>

<div class="blk">
<p class="indd">1. Venus.</p>

<p>Mentioned by the Conde de la Viñaza as forming part of Godoy’s
collection at Madrid.</p>

<p class="indd">2 and 3. The Madhouse.</p>

<p>Academia de San Fernando, Madrid, and copy in the collection of Don A.
de Beruete, Madrid.</p>

<p class="indd">4. ‘La Maja Vestida’ and ‘La Maja Denuda.’</p>

<p>The two famous pictures in the Academy of San Fernando at Madrid are
regarded as portraying a favourite of Manuel Godoy, the ‘Prince of the
Peace’; others maintain that they are portraits of the painter’s
mistress. Both paintings are from the same model. The one represents a
young and beautiful woman reclining at full length upon a couch, her
shoulders sustained by soft cushions, her head somewhat advanced by her
hand crossed at the back of her neck, the upper part of the left arm
supported by the cushions. Her lustrous, expressive eyes are turned
towards the spectator. She is habited in Oriental costume, a diaphanous
yellow vest, and clinging skirt beneath, of tender rose colour,
revealing the contour of the lower limbs.</p>

<p>The second figure is entirely nude, and in precisely the same attitude
as the companion picture. Relieved of the head-dress, her curling
tresses fall luxuriantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span> about her shoulders; the lace-bedecked pillows
and drapery upon the couch in charming contrast with the lovely
flesh-tints. In short, these life-size figures are amongst the choicest
examples of the master. Had Goya always painted thus it had been vain to
blame, and useless to praise him.</p>

<p class="indd">5. The Majas of the Balcony.</p>

<p>Two young women are seated on a balcony, one in a white robe with black
mantilla, the other in a dark dress with white mantilla. Behind them two

<p class="cb"><big><big>THE<br /> SPANISH SERIES</big></big></p>

<p class="c">Edited by ALBERT F. CALVERT</p>

<p>A new and important series of volumes, dealing with Spain in its various
aspects, its history, its cities and monuments. Each volume will be
complete in itself in a uniform binding, and the number and excellence
of the reproductions from pictures will justify the claim that these
books comprise the most copiously illustrated series that has yet been
issued, some volumes having over 300 pages of reproductions of pictures,
etc.</p>

<p class="chuge">MURILLO</p>

<p class="nind">A BIOGRAPHY AND APPRECIATION. ILLUSTRATED BY OVER 165 REPRODUCTIONS FROM
PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS MOST CELEBRATED PICTURES</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While the names of Murillo and Velazquez are inseparably linked in
the history of Art as Spain’s immortal contribution to the small
band of world-painters, the great Court-Painter to Philip IV. has
ever received the lion’s share of public attention. Many learned
and critical works have been written about Murillo, but whereas
Velazquez has been familiarised to the general reader by the aid of
small, popular biographies, the niche is still empty which it is
hoped that this book will fill.</p>

<p>In this volume the attempt has been made to show the painter’s art
in its relation to the religious feeling of the age in which he
lived, and his own feeling towards his art. Murillo was the product
of his religious era, and of his native province, Andalusia. To
Europe in his lifetime he signified little or nothing. He painted
to the order of the religious houses in his immediate vicinity; his
works were immured in local monasteries and cathedrals, and,
passing immediately out of circulation, were forgotten or never
known.</p></div>

<p class="chuge">SPANISH ARMS AND ARMOUR</p>

<p class="nind">A HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE ROYAL ARMOURY AT MADRID.
ILLUSTRATED WITH 386 REPRODUCTIONS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS. DEDICATED BY
SPECIAL PERMISSION TO H.M. QUEEN MARIA CRISTINA OF SPAIN</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Although several valuable and voluminous catalogues of the Spanish
Royal Armoury have, from time to time, been compiled, this “finest
collection of armour in the world” has been subjected so often to
the disturbing influences of fire, removal, and re-arrangement,
that no hand catalogue of the Museum is available, and this book
has been designed to serve both as a historical souvenir of the
institution and a record of its treasures.</p>

<p>The various exhibits with which the writer illustrates his
narrative are reproduced to the number of nearly 400 on art paper,
and the selection of weapons and armour has been made with a view
not only to render the series interesting to the general reader,
but to present a useful text book for the guidance of artists,
sculptors, antiquaries, costumiers, and all who are engaged in the
reproduction or representation of European armoury.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_670" id="page_670">{670}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">A HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE SPANISH ROYAL PALACE,
MONASTERY AND MAUSOLEUM. ILLUSTRATED WITH PLANS AND 278 REPRODUCTIONS
FROM PICTURES AND PHOTOGRAPHS</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Royal Palace, Monastery, and Mausoleum of El Escorial, which
rears its gaunt, grey walls in one of the bleakest but most
imposing districts in the whole of Spain, was erected to
commemorate a victory over the French in 1557. It was occupied and
pillaged by the French two and a-half centuries later, and twice it
has been greatly diminished by fire; but it remains to-day, not
only the incarnate expression of the fanatic religious character
and political genius of Philip II., but the greatest mass of
wrought granite which exists on earth, the leviathan of
architecture, the eighth wonder of the world.</p>

<p>In the text of this book the author has endeavoured to reconstitute
the glories and tragedies of the living past of the Escorial, and
to represent the wonders of the stupendous edifice by reproductions
of over two hundred and seventy of the finest photographs and
pictures obtainable. Both as a review and a pictorial record it is
hoped that the work will make a wide appeal among all who are
interested in the history, the architecture, and the art of Spain.</p></div>

<p class="chuge">TOLEDO</p>

<p class="nind">A HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE “CITY OF GENERATIONS,” WITH
510 ILLUSTRATIONS</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The origin of Imperial Toledo, “the crown of Spain, the light of
the world, free from the time of the mighty Goths,” is lost in the
impenetrable mists of antiquity. Mighty, unchangeable, invincible,
the city has been described by Wörmann as “a gigantic open-air
museum of the architectural history of early Spain, arranged upon a
lofty and conspicuous table of rock.”</p>

<p>But while some writers have declared that Toledo is a theatre with
the actors gone and only the scenery left, the author does not
share the opinion. He believes that the power and virility upon
which Spain built up her greatness is reasserting itself. The
machinery of the theatre of Toledo is rusty, the pulleys are jammed
from long disuse, but the curtain is rising steadily if slowly, and
already can be heard the tuning-up of fiddles in its ancient
orchestra.</p>

<p>In this belief the author of this volume has not only set forth the
story of Toledo’s former greatness, but has endeavoured to place
before his readers a panorama of the city as it appears to-day, and
to show cause for his faith in the greatness of the Toledo of the
future.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_671" id="page_671">{671}</a></span></p>

<p class="chuge">SEVILLE</p>

<p class="nind">A HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT, WITH 300 ILLUSTRATIONS</p>

<p>Seville, which has its place in mythology as the creation of
Hercules, and was more probably founded by the Phœnicians, which
became magnificent under the Roman rule, was made the capital of
the Goths, became the centre of Moslem power and splendour, and
fell before the military prowess of St. Ferdinand, is still the
Queen of Andalusia, the foster-mother of Velazquez and Murillo, the
city of poets and pageantry and love.</p>

<p>Seville is always gay, and responsive and fascinating to the
receptive visitor, and all sorts of people go there with all sorts
of motives. The artist repairs to the Andalusian city to fill his
portfolio; the lover of art makes the pilgrimage to study Murillo
in all his glory. The seasons of the Church attract thousands from
reasons of devotion or curiosity. And of all these myriad visitors,
who go with their minds full of preconceived notions, not one has
yet confessed to being disappointed in Seville.</p>

<p>The author has here attempted to convey in the illustrations an
impression of this laughing city where all is gaiety and mirth and
ever-blossoming roses, where the people pursue pleasure as the
serious business of life in an atmosphere of exhilarating
enjoyment.</p>

<p class="chuge">THE PRADO</p>

<p class="nind">A GUIDE AND HANDBOOK TO THE ROYAL PICTURE GALLERY OF MADRID. ILLUSTRATED
WITH 221 REPRODUCTIONS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS OF OLD MASTERS. DEDICATED BY
SPECIAL PERMISSION TO H.R.H. PRINCESS HENRY OF BATTENBERG</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This volume is an attempt to supplement the accurate but formal
notes contained in the official catalogue of a picture gallery
which is considered the finest in the world. It has been said that
the day one enters the Prado for the first time is an important
event like marriage, the birth of a child, or the coming into an
inheritance; an experience of which one feels the effects to the
day of one’s death.</p>

<p>The excellence of the Madrid gallery is the excellence of
exclusion; it is a collection of magnificent gems. Here one becomes
conscious of a fresh power in Murillo, and is amazed anew by the
astonishing apparition of Velazquez; here is, in truth, a rivalry
of miracles of art.</p>

<p>The task of selecting pictures for reproduction from what is
perhaps the most splendid gallery of old masters in existence, was
one of no little difficulty, but it is believed that the collection
is representative, and that the letterpress will form a serviceable
companion to the visitor to The Prado.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_672" id="page_672">{672}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MOSLEM RULE IN SPAIN, TOGETHER WITH A PARTICULAR
ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTRUCTION, THE ARCHITECTURE, AND THE DECORATION OF THE
MOORISH PALACE, WITH 460 ILLUSTRATIONS. DEDICATED BY SPECIAL PERMISSION
TO H.I.M. THE EMPRESS EUGÉNIE</p>

<p>This volume is the third and abridged edition of a work which the
author was inspired to undertake by the surpassing loveliness of
the Alhambra, and by his disappointment in the discovery that no
such thing as an even moderately adequate illustrated souvenir of
“this glorious sanctuary of Spain” was obtainable. Keenly conscious
of the want himself, he essayed to supply it, and the result is a
volume that has been acclaimed with enthusiasm alike by critics,
artists, architects, and archæologists.</p>

<p>In his preface to the first edition, Mr. Calvert wrote: “The
Alhambra may be likened to an exquisite opera which can only be
appreciated to the full when one is under the spell of its magic
influence. But as the witchery of an inspired score can be recalled
by the sound of an air whistled in the street, so&mdash;it is my
hope&mdash;the pale ghost of the Moorish fairy-land may live again in
the memories of travellers through the medium of this pictorial
epitome.”</p>

<p class="chuge">EL GRECO</p>

<p class="nind">A BIOGRAPHY AND APPRECIATION. ILLUSTRATED BY REPRODUCTIONS OF OVER 140
OF HIS PICTURES</p>

<p>In a Series such as this, which aims at presenting every aspect of
Spain’s eminence in art and in her artists, the work of Domenico
Theotocópuli must be allotted a volume to itself. “El Greco,” as he
is called, who reflects the impulse, and has been said to
constitute the supreme glory of the Venetian era, was a Greek by
repute, a Venetian by training, and a Toledan by adoption. His
pictures in the Prado are still catalogued among those of the
Italian School, but foreigner as he was, in his heart he was more
Spanish than the Spaniards.</p>

<p>El Greco is typically, passionately, extravagantly Spanish, and
with his advent, Spanish painting laid aside every trace of
Provincialism, and stepped forth to compel the interest of the
world. Neglected for many centuries, and still often misjudged, his
place in art is an assured one. It is impossible to present him as
a colourist in a work of this nature, but the author has got
together reproductions of no fewer than 140 of his pictures&mdash;a
greater number than has ever before been published of El Greco’s
works.</p>

<p class="nind">A BIOGRAPHY AND APPRECIATION. ILLUSTRATED WITH 142 REPRODUCTIONS FROM
PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS MOST CELEBRATED PICTURES</p>

<p>Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez&mdash;“our Velazquez,” as Palomino
proudly styles him&mdash;has been made the subject of innumerable books
in every European language, yet the Editor of this Spanish Series
feels that it would not be complete without the inclusion of yet
another contribution to the broad gallery of Velazquez literature.</p>

<p>The great Velazquez, the eagle in art&mdash;subtle, simple,
incomparable&mdash;the supreme painter, is still a guiding influence of
the art of to-day. This greatest of Spanish artists, a master not
only in portrait painting, but in character and animal studies, in
landscapes and historical subjects, impressed the grandeur of his
superb personality upon all his work. Spain, it has been said, the
country whose art was largely borrowed, produced Velazquez, and
through him Spanish art became the light of a new artistic life.</p>

<p>The author cannot boast that he has new data to offer, but he has
put forward his conclusions with modesty; he has reproduced a great
deal that is most representative of the artist’s work; and he has
endeavoured to keep always in view his object to present a concise,
accurate, and readable life of Velazquez.</p>

<p class="chuge">ROYAL PALACES OF SPAIN</p>

<p class="nind">A HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL PALACES OF
THE SPANISH KINGS. PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED</p>

<p>Spain is beyond question the richest country in the world in the
number of its Royal Residences, and while few are without artistic
importance, all are rich in historical memories. Thus, from the
Alcazar at Seville, which is principally associated with Pedro the
Cruel, to the Retiro, built to divert the attention of Philip IV.
from his country’s decay; from the Escorial, in which the gloomy
mind of Philip II. is perpetuated in stone, to La Granja, which
speaks of the anguish and humiliation of Christina before Sergeant
Garcia and his rude soldiery; from Aranjuéz to Rio Frio, and from
El Pardo, darkened by the agony of a good king, to Miramar, to
which a widowed Queen retired to mourn: all the history of Spain,
from the splendid days of Charles V. to the present time, is
crystallised in the Palaces that constitute the patrimony of the
Crown.</p>

<p>The Royal Palaces of Spain are open to visitors at stated times,
and it is hoped that this volume, with its wealth of illustrations,
will serve the visitor both as a guide and a souvenir.</p>

<p class="nind">A HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT, WITH 390 ILLUSTRATIONS</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The glory of Valladolid has departed, but the skeleton remains, and
attached to its ancient stones are the memories that Philip II. was
born here, that here Cervantes lived, and Christopher Columbus
died. In this one-time capital of Spain, in the Plaza Mayor, the
fires of the Great Inquisition were first lighted, and here Charles
V. laid the foundation of the Royal Armoury, which was afterwards
transferred to Madrid.</p>

<p>More than seven hundred years have passed since Oviedo was the
proud capital of the Kingdoms of Las Asturias, Leon, and Castile.
Segovia, though no longer great, has still all the appurtenances of
greatness, and with her granite massiveness and austerity, she
remains an aristocrat even among the aristocracy of Spanish cities.
Zamora, which has a history dating from time almost without date,
was the key of Leon and the centre of the endless wars between the
Moors and the Christians, which raged round it from the eighth to
the eleventh centuries.</p>

<p>In this volume the author has striven to re-create the ancient
greatness of these six cities, and has preserved their memories in
a wealth of excellent and interesting illustrations.</p></div>

<p>In Leon, once the capital of the second kingdom in Spain; in
Burgos, which boasts one of the most magnificent cathedrals in
Spain, and the custodianship of the bones of the Cid; and in
Salamanca, with its university, which is one of the oldest in
Europe, the author has selected three of the most interesting
relics of ancient grandeur in this country of departed greatness.</p>

<p>Leon to-day is nothing but a large agricultural village, torpid,
silent, dilapidated; Burgos, which still retains traces of the
Gotho-Castilian character, is a gloomy and depleting capital; and
Salamanca is a city of magnificent buildings, a broken hulk, spent
by the storms that from time to time have devastated her.</p>

<p>Yet apart from the historical interest possessed by these cities,
they still make an irresistible appeal to the artist and the
antiquary. They are content with their stories of old-time
greatness and their cathedrals, and these ancient architectural
splendours, undisturbed by the touch of a modernising and
renovating spirit, continue to attract the visitor.</p>

<p class="nind">A HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE SPANISH CAPITAL, WITH 450
ILLUSTRATIONS</p>

<p>Madrid is at once one of the most interesting and most maligned
cities in Europe. It stands at an elevation of 2,500 feet above the
sea leve, in the centre of an arid, treeless, waterless, and
wind-blown plain; but whatever may be thought of the wisdom of
selecting a capital in such a situation, one cannot but admire the
uniqueness of its position, and the magnificence of its buildings,
and one is forced to admit that, having fairly entered the path of
progress, Madrid bids fair to become one of the handsomest and most
prosperous of European cities.</p>

<p>The splendid promenades, the handsome buildings, and the spacious
theatres combine to make Madrid one of the first cities of the
world, and the author has endeavoured with the aid of the camera,
to place every feature and aspect of the Spanish metropolis before
the reader. Some of the illustrations reproduced here have been
made familiar to the English public by reason of the interesting
and stirring events connected with the Spanish Royal Marriage, but
the greater number were either taken by the author, or are the work
of photographers specially employed to obtain new views for the

PICTURES</p>

<p>The last of the old masters and the first of the moderns, as he has
been called, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes is not so
familiarised to English readers as his genius deserves. He was born
at a time when the tradition of Velazquez was fading, and the
condition of Spanish painting was debased almost beyond hope of
salvation; he broke through the academic tradition of imitation;
“he, next to Velazquez, is to be accounted as the man whom the
Impressionists of our time have to thank for their most definite
stimulus, their most immediate inspiration.”</p>

<p>The genius of Goya was a robust, imperious, and fulminating genius;
his iron temperament was passionate, dramatic, and revolutionary;
he painted a picture as he would have fought a battle. He was an
athletic, warlike, and indefatigable painter; a naturalist like
Velazquez; fantastic like Hogarth; eccentric like Rembrandt; the
last flame-coloured flash of Spanish genius.</p>

<p>It is impossible to reproduce his colouring; but in the
reproductions of his works the author has endeavoured to convey to
the reader some idea of Goya’s boldness of style, his mastery of
frightful shadows and mysterious lights, and his genius for
expressing all terrible emotions.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
